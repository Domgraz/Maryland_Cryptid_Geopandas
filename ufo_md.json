I was a Honorable Dischared Air Force Medical Tech.  I waited a full 20 to 40 minites to report to base security because of fear of los of reputation.

It was silver in color and made no noise.i was in a type of slow moton shock because I was considering backing down highway for fear of fire and life.

I then realized it was a long line of lights, three or four single file and then two in echelon, three or four single file, then two in echelon - it kept repeating until 25 of the lights had passed overhead. No sound from jet engines and no blinking lights. All of the dots in the sky were a soft yellowish-white and all moved rapidly to the northeast. I started counting after a few had passed so it was probably more than 25. \n \nThey came into view and then rapidly faded out of view as they proceeded northeast. I do not know if that was because their illumination was so soft, or if they literally had just appeared in the southwest sky, to disappear in the northeast sky. \n \nIf they were jets they had to have been fighters. Regular commercial aircraft would not have been so close in echelon, and, in fact, one of the echelon formations shifted positions as they passed overhead. (It really struck me that someone had taken their eye off the ball and had allowed their craft to swing from left rear to even on the right with the leading light. It did not seem to be a smooth maneuver.) No idea as to altitude but the objects were the size of stars and that is why I thought it was something going on with Orion’s belt. \n \nWhile looking at the first two I briefly wondered if they were some sort of satellite but it rapidly became obvious that the objects were not in outer space but in the atmosphere. \n \nThere was a clear sky, temperatures in the upper 20’s, no moon, stars could be clearly seen. No wind. I estimate the time of sighting lasted two minutes, when I went in the house after the last one flew over it was 5:39. \n \nMy location is on the east coast flyway so I see a lot of aircraft overhead both day and night. Sometimes the commercial aircraft can be heard even when very high up, other times no sound is heard. This is a rural area; the night sky is very vivid. I often look up to see the stars or watch an aircraft in the night sky. The objects I saw do not fit anything I have seen before, there were no navigation lights. Also, while we have military aircraft go over now and then, I have never seen a long line formation such as I witnessed tonight. \n \nAnd Orion was not in the sky at that point, I had made a mistake when looking up as the objects at first looked like Orion’s belt and with the one’s in echelon I thought for a second I was seeing two belts. \n \nI was completely sober and not on any medical drugs when the sighting occurred. I was out at such an unusual hour as I had not been able to sleep so went to complete grocery shopping at the 24-hour Walmart up the road.

Our home is rural (dead center of the DELMARVA Peninsula) with a perfect night sky for star watching, which I do regularly. I stepped out of my truck on the west side facing the Chesapeake Bay. While looking out and upward, I thought I identified Orion’s belt, but I quickly realized that is was 4 stars not 3 and the rest of his body was missing. I looked to the east towards the moon and identified a bright star to its bottom left. I looked back at the 4 stars and realized they were moving. The lights appeared to be far above plane altitudes as there were multiple planes flying in different directions at different altitudes (normal activity). The planes were obvious by their running lights. Additionally, there is a great deal of government activity, regularly, so planes and the associated noise are normal. I began to yell to my husband to “look, look, what is that?” Immediately, in my heart,! I knew it was not earthly. At first, I thought the “star-like lights” were horizontal beside each other, but then I realized they were moving single file, one behind the other. Most important to their movement was the distance between them never wavered. It was if they were connected somehow by material or an unseen force. The first two were closer to one another, and then the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th light were evenly distributed. My first thought on their movement was how the animation of Santa sailing across the sky moves…deliberate, smooth, silent, racing. It was like the lights were a train with an engine car and then individual cars. I was mad at myself for not having my phone, which I had noted earlier when I missed the beaver moon shot on the way to town. I wanted to run to the house to get it, but I was afraid of missing any of this event. The lights appeared to be moving from the south west on a curve directly towards and over our farm. As they moved closer, I ran to th! e house through the west side door, grabbed the phone, and hea! ded out the south side door (mere seconds). I fumbled to get the recorder going as I continued to watch the event unfold. The 4 lights continued what seemed like a curve and headed south east. As they trailed away, I could only see the last light because of their single file position. The video is terrible.

We had both had previous UFO experiences and had done our reading on the subject. The object started out white then vacillated, blue, then red, than white again. It was spherical at first but as it moved in a small up and down motion the shape became unclear. It moved up and down, then left and right but not far enough for the manuverability of a plane. It seeme to get a bit closer. I had been talking with Josh and watching it at the same time for about five minutes before I got a strong uneasy feeling. I looked around then back at the object. After a few seconds the feeling subsided. About eight minutes later the feeling came back but stronger. It was strong enough to make me gasp out loud. I felt like it was watching me. It seemed to come a bit closer before it flickered a few times then dissapeared. The anxious feeling subsided then.

We stood there trying to make a meal over the fire but we couldn't even keep the fire going because we were so distracted by all of this taking place. The craft seemed to fly toward the ocean getting brighter again. The colors were shifting is rapidly and with no set pattern just random. Purples , red, orange , green, so many colors alternating from this glowing orb in the distance .. then something caught our eye and coming from the south now had flown over us, directly over us and pretty low and we could hear nothing. I could see the lights underneath and some circle shapes under this craft, about three lights and they lit up some circle shapes underneath the craft. This went on and off for an hour at least. After this craft flee overhead we were just absolutely stunned and in shock. After all seemed still for a while maybe 20 minutes, we saw another light facing north and another was circling around it as if they were doing some sort of dance. These UFOs looked like they were shape shifting , one second it is as huge white light like a fire, next it was blue dots flashing then all the colors and purples and oranges and pulsating.

Leaving on a few miles from the local grocery store and the fan fan on top of their roof occasaionally make this sound also.  Realizing that it wasn't coming from the direction of the grocery store I walked out from behind the house and looked skyward.  There it was hoovering in the sky in a Northwest direction.  It was about 3 miles away. After spotting this object I ran in the house going through the kitchen yelling flying saucer.  I noticed the time on the clock that was hanging on hte wall above the kitchen sink.  I ran arounf the dinning room table to my mother's china closet and I grabed my mother's bincoluar's and ran back outside to get a better view.  With the bincoular's up to my eyes I could see that it was saucer shape with a dome on top and a dome underneath  slightly smaller than what was on top.

At this point, we see one almost every night right outside our window. The UFO is a bright light, there are minor differences like shapes, (circular vs diamond), light emissions, and coloration, but for the most part we feel we are seeing the same things, multiples of them, many different times. They move and we track them but mostly they stay stationary or only more slightly. We can easily monitor this as we live in a wooded area and it’s easy to notice where it’s located in relation to the trees. Recently they’ve been more “obvious” like a bright “star” right in front of us, “following” us home, and being directly outside our windows at night. Today was the first time I tried to record them with some phenomenal results. I recorded a video and took very clear and obvious photos with my iPhone and DSLR. The iPhone videos were surprisingly clear showing a large bright circle, su! rrounding a smaller circle with a dark “core” like center. I took multiple videos all showing the same thing. When zooming in the outer brighter circle was flickering/emitting/spinning. When we went outside to investigate further we spotted another and proceeded to verify via video. The shape and characteristics were both the same. We could see both at the same time.  To note, we both have a masters degree, I being a research biologist and  very familiar with star positioning, plausible tech explanation and so forth. Theses “lights” have been phenomenal experiences. Please contact for further  photos and video, would love to have them investigated further. This is the second home in this area  where we’ve been able to easily see these hovering crafts behaving different from any technology we know of. \n \n", "posted": "2020-01-31T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "38.3545", "city_longitude": "-76.5664", "latitude": 38.3545, "longitude": -76.5664 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.5664, 38.3545 ] } },

First let me say that I am sorry for waiting so long to report this “officially” as it never occurred to me to do so until today. \n \nThis “event” and possible “abduction” happened while I was in the military and home on leave. \n \nI don’t recall the exact date or even the month but I do remember that it happened in 1993 and it wasn’t cold outside yet, there were still green leaves on the trees so it was in between the months of May to September. \n \nMy parents lived in Lusby, Maryland at the time and I was home on leave for the weekend. They had left for the weekend to visit family and I had the house to myself.  No one was home but me. \n \nBeing in the military (Navy) trained me to not need an alarm clock.  I was up by 6 a.m. every day (weekends too) without the use of ANY alarm clocks at all.  I never could sleep in even if I wanted to. \n \nI should say right now that I am relatively light sleeper and a lucid dreamer, that being said, I don’t believe that my encounter was a dream in any way.  I just wanted to mention that to show that what happened to me that night was something different than ANY lucid dream I had EVER had…  Please do not dismiss what I am about to say based on what I have admitted to.  In fact, I would like to get to the bottom of this once and for all to understand that what happened to me that night DID in fact happen.  So here’s my encounter:   I went to bed that Friday night at around 10 p.m. or 2200 hrs if you wish.  I don’t recall what time it was but at some point in the night I was roused to consciousness by what appeared to be very bright flashlight type lights being shined on my bedroom window.  They were bright enough to light my entire room.  Needless to say, I got up and went to the front door to see who it was shining those bright lights at my bedroom window.  When I opened the door I couldn’t believe what I saw…  I saw a craft, maybe 40’ in diameter that looked like a yoyo only flatter.  By that I mean it looked like two saucer shaped craft that were joined in the middle about two thirds of the way in.  The outer most edges of each half of the craft had a row of lights around them as well.  This may sound strange but I can’t remember whether the lights were multi colored or white.  The craft hung just above the tree line over the dirt road in front of the house and it was giving off the purest of white ! blue light from the bottom of the craft that fanned out beneath it.  There was also a sort of sparkle or electricity to the light. \n \nNow THIS is where it gets “different” for me.  Inside of this brilliant light was standing a tall skinny being with very long “bony” for lack of a better word, legs and arms with hands that had long bony fingers that seemed a bit out of proportion to the rest of the body.  I can’t remember if the being was clothed or not (don’t know why but I don’t).  I can tell you that it had a humanoid head with eyes that were VERY human, very thin lips and a thin almost nonexistent nose.  What also struck me odd about this being is that it had what looked like very long hair, only it was real thick, almost like dread locks but not nearly as messy…  So I am standing in my front door looking at this craft/light and being standing on the dirt road looking at ME and I am thinking to myself that I should run!  But where too?!  I don’t know where to go… I am paralyzed with fear.  I want to run so badly…  But then I hear a voice, not out loud, but IN MY HEAD!!! It says to  me, “Don’t be afraid.”  “You have no reason to be afraid.”  And all at once, I was calm.  I told myself, “I have nothing to be afraid of….”  And that was that. \n \nJust before waking up/coming to the next morning I had flash backs to when I was a child living in Fort Washington, Maryland and standing in my back yard looking up at the very same craft only this time it had what the voice in my head called  a “companion craft” with it.  All I saw of the companion craft were its lights and that the lights were in the shape of a triangle and that it moved around the main craft. \n \n(Totally unrelated to this story but possibly relevant is the fact that I also suffered from “missing time” while living there as a child)   Anyway, like I stated above, no matter what day it was, whether I had duty or it was an off day or weekend, I ALWAYS woke up at 6 a.m. NO EXCEPTIONS.  I NEVER slept in.  Except for this Saturday, I didn’t wake up this Saturday until 10:30 ish and I felt drugged.  VERY disoriented and a bit unstable (walking wise) and my nose hurt and was a bit bloody.  One nostril more so over the other. I believe it was my left nostril but I can’t recall.  I just know that when I woke up it felt like at some point I had my whole finger shoved up my nose. \n \nNow, some years later, I think it was 2003, I had a full body MRI done just out of curiosity.  No medical reason what so ever, just a company offered it as a means of early detection of heart disease or cancer.  So I paid to have the scan done.  I was shocked to be told that I have a small mass on one of my lungs (I should know which one but I don’t.)  I can get medical records of the scans though as I have had a scan done on the mass three times now to “monitor” its possible growth and it has shown no sign of change. \n \nNow, I was told by one doctor early on that they were a bit confused as this mass was not “calcified” so it should be growing in size at least slowly but since it isn’t doing anything they were not going to biopsy it so as not to provoke it…  Anyway, the most recent scan was within the past 12 months and there still has been no change in whatever is in my lung. \n \nI don’t know if the mass in my lung and the encounter I had are related but I thought I would add that in just as a side. \n \nIn conclusion, I hope that my account can be of some assistance to you and maybe someone can assist me in trying to determine if this was a dream or reality.  I would have chalked it up to just a dream if it weren’t for the way I felt and the time at which I woke up Saturday, or the fact that my nose was bloody and sore. \n \nThank you for your time. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Its light puslasted slowly at different intensities, and clearly was not a star. A later observation concluded that the object was below cloud level.  It moved to many different positions in the night sky in the duration of the sighting. It observed no typical aerial movement attributed to planes or helicopters, and it did not have any wing lights, or any light attributed to any normal aircraft.  It was in the sky for hours - Long enough to have one of my buddies with a high quality camera to come over and photograph and videotape it AFTER we came back from the convenience store. Meanwhile, about 5-10 minutes into our drive towards the Wawa in Charlotte Hall,  (This was after the initial orb si! ghting) we observed three of the same orbs in a triangular formation about halfway up the size of a cell phone tower like this one (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Nyakrom_OneTouch_Cell_Phone_Tower_Vodaphone.jpg) in the sky.

Now the strangest thing about this! object is coming from the bottom center it had a black tube looking object coming from it about half the size of the craft.Now while I watched this craft I had the strange feeling that it was hunting for something. I watched it until it went out of sight, or as if it blended into the enviroment.I will always remember that day, it will always be very clear in my mind.And then the very next night I went over again to take my mother to the store, we go to the stop sign again, it is around 10;00 pm and there flying at an average speed was many bright white lights flying scattered all over the sky making no sound. When we got home we were watching the news and the castors were talking about the strange lights flying over Andrews Airforce base, and making jokes about them being ufos flying over the base.

I am a Federal Police officer and I worked downtown in Washington, D.C. I decided to take off early that Friday night due to boredom when I arrived home at around 2115 hours.  All the lights were off in my house but my husband and eleven year old daughter were in the family room watching TV.  My husband (now ex-husband) went to take a shower while my daughter and I remained in the family room watching the TV. I decided to make hot chocolate for her and coffee for me in our kitchen which was dimly illuminated by the under range top light, when I heard my daughter tell me in a very startled voice, \"Mommy, come look at the lights!\"  I told her to hold on a minute while I finished making our drinks, but her voice became even more desperate almost pleading with me to come look at the lights, and finally she started crying and almost in a state of panic, \"look at the lights!\"  I thought she had turned the lights on in the family room because my kitchen lit up as if every light were on.  I turned around and couldn't believe my eyes when I realized how brightly lit our family room was.  It was a very warm October night, about 68 degrees outside, so we had a few of our windows open, including my sliding glass door in the kitchen which leads to the backyard where my dog Cleo was.  Cleo is a black lab, doberman, dalmation mix, who weighs about 95 lbs. \n \nI told her to wait inside while I went outside to see who or what was in my driveway.  As I walked outside, I noticed three circular lights at about tree level across the street at my neighbors house.  The tree was about 35 feet in height and the neighbors house was only about 20 feet high.  In relationship to my house and my driveway, the circular lights were approximately 75 feet from me and were intensely bright.  The circles of light were lined up horizontally and about 35 feet off of the ground.  The circle in the middle was large and appeared to be five feet or so wide, the smaller lights on each side appeared to be two to three feet wide and all three ligths were a combination of amber, cream and white.  A color that I have never seen before or since.  The lights gave off or emitted heat and there was a humming noise in the air.  When I walked out further to try and see what these lights were and where they were coming from, they moved quickly from horizontal to vertical, with the largest light still in the middle.  The larger light seemed to be gyrating or oscillating and the lights appeared to be moving closer to me in which the lights became even more intensely bright, almost blinding me and there was heat being emitted.  I didn't realize that my little girl had ran outside the door after me, so when I realized the lights were coming closer, and now I placed them at about 30 feet away from me the lights appeared to be like a \"beacon\" almost with a circular shape and almost to where you couldn't tell where one circle was from the other -- like they fused together.  I turned around and ran inside, not realizing my child was outside crying, I ran back out to get her and I got her inside when my dog and other neighborhood dogs started growling and howling and acting almost as if she were spooked or rabid, she busted through the screen door and began barking and snarling at the front door.  At that point I ran into the bathroom and pullled my husband from the shower with my hysterics about what my daughter and I were seeing outside.  By the time my husband got the soap out of his eyes and a towel on him, we ran out to the front yard where the object still was brightly illuminated in our driveway, when the lights separated into three discs and sped off at at a rate of speed that most conventional airplanes could do and at what appeared to be a 45 degree angle.  You could see a vapor trail of where they left because it was partly cloudy with the moon behind my house which is located in a southwesterly direction.  When the police arrived, some of my neighbors came out to ask me if I had seen or heard anything because their dogs were going nuts and my daughter and I explained what we had seen.  But my daughter saw it first so I have no idea of where they came from or how they descended to tree level.  I think the sheriff's deputy thought my child and I were crazy, but my ex-husband who really didn't get a good look at anything too much agreed that my child and I definitely saw something, particularly convincing was the fact that our dog busted through our screen door and didn't calm down until ten minutes after the lights disappeared. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I even caught 2 pictures of it on my picture phone which made the object look much smaller than it actually appeared from my point of view. (will be posted on the bottom of this page). \n \nFirst, I saw a bright flash out of the corner of my eye. I thought to myself that it must have been a spotlight rotating in the sky which I see from time to time but it never came back around so I dismissed it and moved on.  Soon after, I saw 3 bright lights in the distance behind the wood line coming towards the front of my house moving at a considerably slow speed and very quiet.  While moving forward nonetheless. shortly afer spotting the oblect in the distance, it finally arrived at the top of the horizon and almost over my house.  At this time I immediately called my brother, informed him of the spotting not knowing where he was and then hung up the phone to proceed taking a video with the camera on my phone.  When I was done, in my haste, I hit the end button deleting the video.  Quickly, I started to take a picture before it was completely out of view. \n \nI acquired two photos; One showing an object with 3 bright lights in a triangular formation on the bottom surface of an object which was not fully visible due to the darkness of it over the night sky though I do beleive it was triangular aswell. The second, shows the same light formation, this time, with the 3 white lights dimmed and a red one in the center. For whatever reason it appeared this way in the photo, I don't know, but there was a red light in the center that I could see dimming in and out behind the camera, but luckily each picture portrays a good example of the different lights. \n \nAfter the event I walked inside of my house. 5, maybe 10 minutes go by and my brother whom I had called in the beginning has now called me back.  To my surprise, he tells me that he is on the highway about 7 miles away and could see that where it would seem our house is from where he was at, there was an object over top.  I rush back outside and there was the same exact view I had just witnessed 5 minutes before, same path, same speed, and i was in the same spot.  This confused me because now I didn't know if there was two objects, or if this one traveled back around.  It traveling around is hard to believe because of the incredibly slow speed at which it was moving.  Unless it sped up when I walked inside and it made the loop. \n \nAnyways, after the second go around of which my brother witnessed from several miles away aswell as me, that was the end besides the conversating between the family of what had just happened. The next day some programs on the television described a phenomenon world wide of sightings just like mine that still are considered unidentified.  I was excited and so was he :)  (Images are much smaller than they actually appeared.  Also I am sorry for the poor quality.  The order sequence of taking them was first, the one with 3 white lights, then as I was a little more towards the rear, I took the one that appeared red.)

At approximately 22:00 hours we saw two strange lights coming up over the ocean as we were walking on the beach. The lights (that were constantly changing blue, red and white) were at the same height but they were separated from each other at what seemed to be about the size of a golfball for me. It was sitting there for a minute (app. 30-sec.) and than it moved closer to us toward the beach, as we all got excited about what this could be I was walking closer to the beach and continues focusing my eye on the lights. The lights now were separated at such a way that I could fit a pencil in between. The strange thing is that because the sky was so clear and I had my eye’s focus so much on the object that I could now see that their was a very black “ufo looking” shape in between the lights and the lights seemed to be at the end of  “the wing” of the disk. I am not that good in distance estimation but I believe the object was now above the ocean with at least 750 meters away from us and it had reach a higher position. While the lights were still seem to move toward us the object al of the sudden turned around 180* upside down. Than the object very quickly seemed to move away from us and the lights became very weak and blurry. Than I lost track of the lights and they seemed to have disappeared. App. 30 seconds after that one of us saw it again at a complete different distance. It was now very high in the sky and far away. We say it a couple of times at certain positions far away for a second or two during about 1 minute.

It was around an estimated 1130pm, November 27th, 2010 and we were out on the balcony.  Our room was on the 2nd level, oceanfront, so we were about 50yds from the coastline.  She was reclining on one of the balcony chairs and I stated, \"Hey baby, baby.  What is that?\"   When i noticed it, the object was directly perpendicular to me traveling in a southern direction 40-50yds above the coastline, probably 30 or 40yds from my deck.  I estimate the speed of the unidentified object to be around 25-30mph.  It was dark and very quiet that night and there was not a sound to be heard besides a very ominous silence.  Perhaps a humming or a feeling of something actually being there was what made me look to the sky.  What i saw was a silouette of a triangular craft with about 9 afterburners on the underside.  Four or five on the left definetly, four or five on! the right that were harder to make out because of the difficult angle which really gives a better visual as to how close this craft really was to my position, and 1 afterburner in the lead on this craft which was heading south along the coastline.  These lights were very odd in that they didn't glow bright like any typical vertical afterburner or exhaust nor did they burn like any conventional horizontal exhaust type aircraft.  These lights maintained a steady maroon/deep dull red glow that almost blended in with the nightscape.

Approximately 12:30am, I checked my sliding glass door, looking out to the ocean.  I saw a peculiar object hovering over the water with lights shining down and what appeared to be some sort of \"probes\" reaching into the water below.  I was stunned and just stood there wondering if my eyes were deceiving me.   \n \nI then saw the hovering object pull in the \"probes\" and ascend back up to what appeared to be a larger hovering object up above, higher in the air.  I assumed it to be some sort of \"mother ship\".   \n \nAfter ascending, it descended after a few (?) minutes.  This process repeated approximately 3 times.At this point, approximately 3 hours had passed. I had to get a closer look, although I was fearful.  I walked out on my balcony and saw the lights shine towards me on the coast.  I was horrified thinking this \"thing\" was going to chase me!   \n \nI ran back in to my condo and slammed the door.

Today, 11/16/07 I visited your site again since 8/7/07 and was happy to see my first posting up, so now I would like to post the second one. \n \n The summer of 1990 my extended family was visiting from overseas, and we decided to vacation in Ocean City, MD.  On or about July 20, 1990 after a long day shopping and enjoying the beach weather, my brother and I walked down to the beach for a smoke.  We sat on the shore and talked, when I noticed a set of triangular lights that seemed to dance around each other in the night sky. At first I just thought they were stars, but I also noticed they would blink every now and then, as if they disappeared and reappeared again.  At first I thought, the motion of the waves might have influence over balance, and perhaps on a clear night stars really do twinkle, so I quickly dismissed it as just a quirk. Then suddenly I saw one light dart away from the other two. At first I had hesitated in telling my brother what I had seen, but noticing that the other two lights had now followed the stray light from East to West, I asked him to look up in the sky and tell me what he saw.    My brother then affirmed what I had seen, and we began to speculate as to what it could be, he was the first to say it might be UFOs.  This went on for about 30 minutes, it was definitely not something that was just momentary, it seemed as if the three lights danced around each other, followed each other, and perhaps signaled each other. \n \nThis is my second sighting, both of which I've witnessed with two different family members, who can verify my stories. \n \nI would like to further add that coincidentally on August 1977 I became psyschically intuned with departed loved ones through dreams.  I just find it fascinating that my first sighting which was a direct encounter with a saucer might have enhanced these abilities or are directly attributed to them. \n \n Since my encounters I've read many books, including the powerful Edgar Cayce on Indigo children which represent a new evolutionary human society.  Emissaries from heaven is the term that is associated with children with psychic abilities.  I was 13 when I became psychically aware. \n \n I want to thank your website for helping me realize that what I have witnessed is not something I dreamt up.", "posted": "2007-11-28T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "38.3378", "city_longitude": "-75.0873", "latitude": 38.3378, "longitude": -75.0873 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -75.0873, 38.3378 ] } },

Wednesday morning, August 6, 2003.  Time was 08:27:30.  The sky consisted of unbroken gray cloud cover approximately 200 feet thick with its base at approximately 400 feet altitude.  Directly above the highway in my line of site at approximately 10 degrees elevation, a small but very bright orange light came shooting out of the cloud base approximately 1600 feet away from me.  The object's trajectory out of the cloud base was horizontal at first but immediately curved sharply downward--directly toward the ground below.  The object continued to burn steady until it passed 100 feet altitude at which time it faded out within a full second and visually ceased to exist.  Estimated speed was approximately 50 feet per second.  I was facing SW.  The object travelled at first from my right going to my left (NW to SE) before diving.  Object appeared star-like similar to Planet Venus in image size and intensity with no noticable form.  If the sighting had occurred at night, the brightness could rival a welder's torch.  Size of object was likely only a couple feet diameter.  Size and distance range was determined by using estimated altitude of cloud ceiling and elevation of object at point of exit from the cloud base.  Object was very close to intersection of Hwy. #301 and Rt. #228 in downtown Waldorf.  There were at least 200 cars between me and that intersection.  There were at least as many cars behind me, as well.  Sighting was brief and unexpected.  No one was seen stopping and getting out of their cars.

I then noticed the object coming closer to the ground.  I immediately became frightened because I was the only one outside in my neighborhood because how late it was. I went inside the house and heard the dog barking across the street and it would not stop barking.  I then got scared that maybe the object saw me so I turned off my lights in my room and went under the blanket.  Thirty minutes later I was touched one time and became dizzy and saw lights shining in my eyes through my blanket.  I believe the extraterrestrial is invisible to the human eye but not invisible in general. I was so scared I didnt move hoping it would leave.  I then went into a sleep still feeling dizzy.  I believe the ext! raterrestrial was touching me making me feel dizzy in hopes I would forget however when I woke up I still remembered everything that happened. Unfortunately the extraterrestrial has been coming every night for the last few nights doing the same activity.  Shining a light in my eyes, touched me one time and shocked me, and making me dizzy. I am not sure what the extraterrestrial wants or why.  I believe it wants me to forget the situation however it frightens me so much its impossible to forget.

The orange orb was amongst the stars in the horizon.  I looked at this for several minutes and asked her to go outside and join me.  She lives 20 miles from me.

I unfortunately could not see the moon so I kept looking and told her about seeing this planet early spring. \n \nAll of a sudden this orange ball starting shooting upward and fast, as if were a rocket.  My first thought was I was witnessing a shooting star.  From my vision it moved on an angle straight up to the left of my vision.  I followed this until it was angling over my house.

I was on the back road between Prince Frederick and Waldorf Maryland.  As I entered a new road (Cederville) I saw what appeared to be an airplane coming in for a landing just above the tree tops. (This is what my mind first said it was.)  As I drove towards it I noticed that it was not moving in any way, not forward or backward or even away or closer to me.  At this point I pull off of the road and shut off my trucks engine.  My windows were open and I could hear no sound of engines at all.  I sat there looking at this UFO and could not make sense of what I was seeing. \n \nI reached for the phone and called my friend and was talking to his wife about it.  As I looked at the object closely I could not see any wings and it looked like a cigar shaped sliver metal fuselage.  I could even see some detail on the surface.  I could see the sun sunning on the surface of the silver metal.  It had a darker area at one end that was a little larger then the rest of the lines of the craft. \n \nThe object was about 1 ½ inches long if the ruler was held at arms length.  As I was talking to my friend wife the object started to move off to the North very slowly and started to come lower and lower.  It went below the tree level but I still could see it on and off as it passed throw the trees.  This is one gage as to how far away the object was.  I would say that it was not very far into the tree line because of this. \n \nAfter I drove around to the other side of the tree line and found nothing.  There are fields on ether side of this tree stand.  I drove next to a church that is in sight of the fields and asked if there is any airfield close to there.  I was told there was none.

I observed it through a trees branches with no leaves, and at first thought, that it was the branches cutting off a stars light.   \n \nAfter about 30 seconds, i realized that it was much brighter then most stars and was indeed pulsing in a pattern.  I walked about 40 feet closer to remove the branches through a large hole in the trees branches.  A 2 bubble like orb of blue light was emitting multiple 1 and 2 second slow growing pulses over a second or two of time of a bright blue color. \n \nAfter about 30 seconds of me staring at it with my jaw to the floor in complete awe, a military fighter jet, likely a newer F35 from pax river research base flew over my house, towards the direction of the blue orb, with the jets direction offset to the west of the object by 10 degrees or so, at a very unusually slow speed that made it extremely quiet and at a very unusually low altitude.  I see fighter planes around my house all the time, for my entire life and I have never seen a fighter plane fly at such a slow speed or such a low altitude with such a quiet dynamic.   \n \nAfter a minute or two, the pulse began to change its tempo, when the plane came closer to it, though its hard to tell exactly how far away from it, the blue orb light compressed to a small white light.  As the fighter plane got a mile or two past my house, and closer to the direction of the 'orb' the light compressed from blue into white and then a thin orange spike that looked like a meteorite trail that ex! tended upwards and began from the point of the light which then disappeared.  The orange trail was very small and very feint, perhaps the size of a needle in the sky with a tail length about as wide as my thumb or a degree or two. \n \nThis object was completely stationary in the sky and did not move until it began to disappear and was not on an orbit what so ever.  I would estimate it was any where from a quarter mile to a mile or so in the sky. \n \nI have contacted multiple flight facilities, looking for any activity from experiments, but this was not a sounding rocket, or an experiment, or a satellite burning up in the atmosphere.  It was completely stationary.  I have studied ball lightning and I can assure that not only was this not ball lightning, but the atmospheric dynamics at the time was not conducive to ball lightning.  This was not anywhere near the altitude of an elfing event nor was this a 'blue sprite'.  The brightness magnitude during the peak of the pulses was around 2 times the brightness of Rigel and barely visible at the low magnitude of the pulses which were at patterns of about a second or two and changed over the minute or two I observed the blue orb. The glow did not give off diffraction spikes like stars and was a smooth glowing blue orb which had smooth gradients of pulses.  The image shape was diamond orb like and gave off a rounded square edged shape at the height of its brightness in pulse.  The speed in which it disappeared was very quickly at around a half a second or less once it became a smaller bright white light.  I observed the object for around 1 or 2 minutes until it disappeared when the jet appraoched it. \n \nI have added photos of a sighting from Puerto Rico in 2017 I found after the event that accurately resemble the shape and dynamics as the orb had a 2 part-like dynamic to it during its pulses with a mild middle dividing line, that made the orb look a bit like two bubbles stuck together.  These are extremely accurate photos to the agreement of what i saw to the point where i believe this is exactly what i saw.   \n \nI contacted flight facility of Wallops and searched for flight or experiment anomolies but found no satellites or sounding rockets that could represent these dynamics or color wavelenghts.", "posted": "2018-03-23T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "38.6955", "city_longitude": "-76.6061", "latitude": 38.6955, "longitude": -76.6061 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.6061, 38.6955 ] } },

The craft resembled an airplane or a drone.   \n \nThe color was silver/brushed gray.  It was the size of a small, early jet airliner perhaps 75-100 feet long.

Two long wings came out from the sides, under the aircraft, and did not appear to be affixed, but gave the impression that they were part of the fuselage as if the whole thing were built as one.  The wings were chopped off at the ends, similar to what was on the old X-15 experimental aircraft, except that they were longer.  The craft had no markings and no markings.  What struck us odd was that it had no tail or landing gear of any sort.  It just remained motionless and hung there.  It did not sway or move in anyway and gave off no noise or light.   \n \nIt was a sunny and perfect day weather-wise.

So I used the high powered laser and made two flashes right on its location and within seconds it replied back with two flashes.  I followed back with three quick flashes and just like before it replies back with the same amount of flashes.  Amazed at what we were witnessing I gave it two quick flashes and two drawn out flashes and after about a second or two it replies with the exact same.  This all had taken place over a 5 minute period.  Then it slowly dimmed down to the same brightness of the surrounding stars and slowly dropped down to the same level as the stars below its first location.  It illuminated bright as before ( which reminded me of little sun ).  So after we both witnessed its movements and it’s intelligent replies it sat for about 3 minutes and slowly faded out.

I was shoveling snow from my deck at the back of the house after shoveling snow from my driveway in the front of my house.  The front of the house faces almost due east.  I would periodically stop about once every five minutes or so to drink a sip of water and to catch “my breath”.  I looked up (in a north north westerly direction) to admire the clear blue skies when I noticed two “birds” flying very high and moving slowly in a westerly direction. \n \nIt struck me as being odd that they we as high as they appeared, not knowing what kind of “white” birds these were or how large they were.  One was about twice as small and appeared to be higher than the other.  Then they began to move in a manner which didn’t fit the movement of birds at all.  I then noticed that didn’t have wings and were white spherical objects, the largest about the size and color of the period on a computer keyboard. \n \nThe higher one stopped and the lower one continued in the same westerly direction I first noticed them, it then reversed (180 degrees) direction and moved rapidly about 3 degrees in that opposite direction for about one second, it reversed direction again, then again a third time and then it stopped.  While this was happening the second object climbed straight up while they both stopped moving at about the same time.   \n \nThe second object, at the higher altitude (again about one half the size as the other object) would appear then disappear while they both were stopped.  They both remained stopped for about three seconds then they both spiraled upwards and disappeared in less than two seconds.  Unfortunately, I didn’t record the event because:  1) it happened as fast as it did, 2) it took me a moment to realize this was not a couple of birds, 3) I thought I had left my cell phone in another jacket, turns out I did have it, I had put it in my back pocket when I took the jacket off.   \n \nAbout 5 minutes after these two spherical objects disappeared a high flying jet with one vapor trail passed over flying to the same location as the two objects were.  This jet appeared (best estimate) to be above 45,000 feet, no sound and appearing all white as it flew over such that I could only see the underside of the plane.

It was then we decided to do our firework.  I glanced over and saw a small white light slowly moving behind-through the trees, hovering back and forth.  We lit it off and got the heck out of dodge, passing by the field where the object was originally sighted.  Nothing.  Darkness.  Coming out of the forest I glanced back and saw that white light above the trees, moving quickly to the right and holding it's position there, rising as we moved further away.

March 30th 2011.  I go to my car and get my cigarettes.  I light one of them and get up out of my car and turn around.  And there is a Black pyramid/triangle shape floating above the back end of my neighborhood over the Fire Department and in front of a Water Tower...   The best way to describe it would have to be like a perfect symmetrical pyramid and/or triangle.  Like if you cut off the top of the Great Pyramid of Giza... \n \nIt was all black.  It made absolutely no noise.  It floated parallel with a major road in my town over the back end of neighborhood.  It was incredible…  There were 4 lights... there were 3 that were you know the normal white light on the 3 corners, 1 in each corner.  And in the center there was a red light..... \n \nNow the only difference is the first time I saw this same similar object with my friend; the red light wasn't blinking.  On, March, 30th 2011 the RED light was BLINKING...  Not sure if it means anything. (I saw a similar object on a separate occasion with a friend, a few years ago probably 2 but in the same county) I called 911.  I have no idea if they took me serious or actually followed it up.  But, I was in shock just for the fact it was so close to my home. \n \nAnother example is if you look at the back of a One Dollar bill.  The eye in the pyramid-that is the closest thing I can think of, but the lights were on the bottom of it... but at the same time it was such a Dark Black that you could see the outline of it perfectly... and in my situation I had a humungous water tower as a backdrop and this thing just floated in front of it.. \n \nI stand by what I saw. And I also stand by the resume that my short life span holds... 4 years military (Active)... 1 year Iraq, 1 year Korea...  I’m now a Disabled Veteran.  Like I said I've seen many things from airplanes to helicopters to balloons and missiles.... and for the sake of the term UFO this was an Unidentified Flying Object... \n \nWhether or not it is Alien or Extra Terrestrial I don’t know.  I know what I saw and I know it was a Black pyramid/triangle floating very slowly over my neighborhood heading towards Route 50 in the state of Maryland.  I will tell anyone what I saw. \n \nI would have to estimate the size as pretty decent considering it bloated out a good portion of the water tower when it floated by. \n \nI would have to say the incident lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes. \n \nThis sighting occurred in Easton, Maryland.

I pulled into the drive way and stopped about halfway down, opened the window, and turned down the radio to see if I could hear anything.  I could not hear any sounds other than the car engine. \n \nI parked the car and we went inside. I pulled out my Binoculars, went to the back porch and proceeded to watch the object. \n \nThere were no visible flashing lights on the object.  It was a very bright whitish/orange and traveling at a steady speed in a North/Northwesterly direction. \n \nI observed aircraft pass over my house and in the distance, all with the telltale flashing lights. This object was considerably brighter than any light on an aircraft.  Too contrast, I witnessed an airplane pass under the object, in relationship to the horizon, and could easily see the flashing lights. \n \nI went inside and brought out our telescope to get a closer look at the object. \n \nI could not make out any visible edges, only light. The object seemed to pulse but never left it's course. \n \nMy youngest daughter and I watched it until it vanished over the horizon. \n \nAs a clarification: We live on one of the flight paths used by Dover AFB. \n \nWe have seen combat helicopters, regular helicopters, Chinooks, A-10s, F-16s, and C130s pass over. Growing up, I lived near Andrews AFB, and we have a small airfield on the outside of town (about 4 miles from me) and Easton airport to the south, So I have a lot of experience with identifying aircraft. \n \nWhat we saw on Wednesday night wasn't anything I have ever seen before. \n \nI wish I had had the foresight to bring out a camera, but I wanted to identify the object first.

Underneath the craft was what appeared to be a thin solid 'line of light' discharging from the bottom of the 'bowl'. The light had the appearance of a fluorescent light (it could have been circular but from my point of view the light was a straight line). It should be noted that this object remained stationary in the sky. I thought it might be moving away from me, but it was not. It should also be noted that there was a full or ¾ full moon that evening, but this object was well away from the moon. I thought, 'Am I really seeing this?'. However, as I passed the tennis courts - with object still in full view - I heard a lady speaking to her husband saying, '...I don't know. I guess it's an alien invasion or something.' I said to her, 'Do you see that?' She stated, 'Yeah, it's really weird.' I agreed and kept walking (with the stationary object now over my left shoulder). As I turned back to look at the object again, it was gone. I could hardly contain myself until I reached the tennis courts again.

Very low for something to be floating or flying.  Only birds.  On the moments before I seen the unknown a flash got my attention to the window which offers a wide view to other side of the narrows. My living room lights were off and was watching t v.   As I was staring out to direction of bright flash a large white- bluish light appeared. My first thought was.  That's not normal.  The bright \"0rb\" seemed to come to edge of ridge line from my point of view.  It then stayed stationary briefly.  Long enough to throw my senses off.  The light or orb moved slightly to the left.  Stopped.  Then moved to left again.  Stopped.   \n \nBy this time it was blocked slightly by trees on the alley I live on.  But was still visible and bright.it had stopped again.

At the last moment of getting up and straining to look out window the light turned from more of a bright white off blue too a all blue light.  It then vanished.  I was shocked because for a second I thought the light was from landing lights on a approaching aircraft.  And was coming straight toward me.after the event I thought to myself. The light was too bright to have been landing lights!!!!  I also tryed to tell myself it is explainable.  I have no idea as to what it was. And I was thinking. Somebody else had to see this.  I decided not to call police. Now a few days after experience I went on the net to see about weird sights in Maryland sky's. Was shocked to see that other reports and the same sounding object I had witnessed. That is how I found this web site to report this. Did not know one ! could do that. What are the odds of seeing something like this! outside my window. Scary. This did happen. I hope someone reads this and can interpret what I saw.

A a semi-rural part of Washington County. I noticed two bright white lights a few hundred feet in the air over a cornfield. At first I thought the lights were headlights on a low flying airplane. They were spaced 50 feet or so apart. I also noticed a smaller red blinking light in between the two white lights that appeared to blink in different places, moving left and right. After watching it for a minute it never appeared to move. I then thought maybe it was lights on a tower but I drive by this field often and I never noticed a tower or lights. I drove by it very slow. It was approximately 300 yards from me. The road wraps around the field so I saw the lights from several angles. They never moved with the exception of the blinking red light. I got to the end of the road and the light weren't visible any more from where I was at. I decided to circle around and have another look. It! took me 5 or 6 minutes to get back around to where I saw the lights and I couldn't find them. After a minute of searching I saw them further away and faint in the distance. Probably 1000 yards or more away. I called my girlfriend and told her that I was chasing lights. I came to the end of Natural Well Road and I turned left onto Falling Waters Road. I drove for 20 seconds or so when I saw two bright lights just above the trees. shining through the tree limbs like headlights in the sky just in front of me. I was still on the phone explaining to my girlfriend what I was seeing. I was driving slow as the road curved around a country church to my left. I noticed two men standing outside of the church but they seemed to be oblivious to the lights above. Just above and behind the church I could see the two white light. I followed the road around. Behind the church was a line of trees that opened up into a small field- actually a large yard to a house nearby. Just beside the lin! e of trees is where I had a close encounter with something. To! the lef t of my car approximately 30 feet and at the top of the trees approximately 40 feet in the air I saw what appeared to be something hovering. Attached were 4 lights. One on each point of the object. There was also a red blinking light somewhere on the object. The object made no sound but it was floating and it actually tilted forward toward me allowing me to see it's diamond shape. It was dark so it was difficult to tell if there were four points or three, it may have been triangle shape but it had four white lights and a red blinking light. At one point I thought I saw a small purple light and a green light. The object seemed to tilt forward and then all the way on it's side. It moved like a feather floating on the wind. I was still on the phone with my girlfriend. When I realized what I was actually seeing I told her \"Oh my God. It's a triangle...it has four lights..it's a UFO babe!\" I told her that I was certain that I was witnessing a space craft. At that point I lost cel! l phone service with her.I was terrified! I continued to drive away very slowly while trying to redial her number. I got a busy signal so I tried again. I got her voicemail, then I tried again. Finally I reconnected the whole time I was too frightened to look out the window to see where the craft was. I drove for a minute or two longer and the road came to a dead end. I turned the car around fearing that I had to drive back from where I spotted the object. Slowly I drove back scanning the sky for lights. I drove right to where I had the encounter and there was nothing there. The lights were gone. I was shaking and still scared but I looked around for a few second and could find nothing of what I just saw. \n \n", "posted": "2010-11-21T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.5921", "city_longitude": "-77.8129", "latitude": 39.5921, "longitude": -77.8129 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.8129, 39.5921 ] } },

Most fascinating is the spectacular light show this thing is giving off and is what first caught my attention. It pulsates with just about every color of the spectrum around the edges of the craft and the bottom portion looks as though it's erupting with fire. Last night the object was much closer and I was able to vaguely make out a shape that I can only describe as something out of battlestar galactica it appeared to be triangular, but not perfectly triangle.

The first time the lights were observed was by 1 person around 11:00pm and was discounted as a plane but in a strange location (not the typical approach to the local airport).  The second time the lights were observed was at 11:50pm by 2 people.  There were multiple lights with different colors (red, yellow, orange) in roughly a straight line but not exactly lined up. \n \nThe lights stayed fairly consistent but did appear to fluctuate somewhat.  Then the lights simply went out.  The craft/lights did not appear to move, land, fly away or otherwise act like a plane, helicopter or other normal aircraft. \n \nThe area that the siting occurred is generally in the path of the local airport (Hagerstown Washington County Regional Airport - HGR) and it is typical for planes to approach the airport from this direction which we observe many times over the years.  When planes come in from a far distance, they appear to be standing still for a few minutes but then move to the left as they approach the airport.  This is the typical observance of landing aircraft seen by us many times.  The first reaction to what was seen on the night of 1-29-13 was that it was just an airplane, but after a few minutes of it \"not moving,\" we went to get binoculars, then the lights went out in about seconds.  Aircraft approaching the airport DO NOT turn their lights out completely right before landing!!  If anything, they turn their landing lights on as they get closer.  Again the craft did not appear to move at all and was seen in the same location about 50 minutes apart, then the lights simply went out.  ! We observed the entire area for another 20 minutes looking for the lights to re-appear, they did not. \n \nAnother concern is that the location of the siting was about +/-10 miles southwest of a military installation known as Site R (aka \"the underground Pentagon\") just north of Camp David.  This area is a strict no-fly zone and aircraft approaching the airport (HGR) must abide by the approved flight path. \n \nOther observations we noted.  We saw some clouds, stars (big dipper), a nearly full moon, communication towers in the far distance with red blinking lights and several high altitude aircraft with their typical red blinking lights which were much farther up in the sky (perhaps 5,000 ft or 10,000 ft).  All of these items are observed nightly, which is normal.  The siting of the mysterious lights were distinct and nothing like the other lights or items listed above. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptionally capable witness.

I initially intended to check the outside temp on a thermometer attatched to my window screen.  It was 22° and very clear.  My attention was quickly diverted to the skyline above Greencastle pike.  Just above the tree line behind my house I noticed a very low flying object which basically looked liked a very bright ball of white light.  I couldn't make out any shape of the craft as the light was too bright.  It continued to fly very slowly in a southern direction towards Hagerstown's west end.  I just assumed it was a Cessna type plane flying low on a landing approach to the Hagerstown airport and I continued admiring the clear morning sky. \n \nAs I'm scanning the sky and looking at what stars, I could see, I noticed two other passenger planes flying at different directions at a much higher altitude than the flying ball of bright light I first noticed.  Both of those planes displayed the blinking red lights that I'm familiar seeing. \n \nThe sight of those higher flying planes made me realize that the plane that I thought was a Cessna wasn't displaying any red or blinking lights at all, just one massive light covering the entire craft.  I also realized that the ball of white light was actually flying towards the center of town, not to the airport as I originally thought because of it's low altitude and speed.  It was literally just ten or fifteen feet above the tree line that runs perpendicular to Greencastle pike and connects to the adjacent neighbourhood. \n \nWhen I gathered all my thoughts together and began to think that this thing may not be a private plane at all, I grabbed for my phone which was charging on the nightstand next to my bed with the intention to shoot some video.  As I raised the phone and fumbled with video mode and focus, the light disappeared as if someone turned off a light switch.  I didn't see a light trail that I would expect to see if the object had accelerated away at high speed, nor could I see a dark outline of an unlit object against the morning sky.  It's as if it were erassed with no trace of it ever being there in the first place. \n \nAt this point I just froze in place. I didn't know how to feel or what to think. I was just numb trying to understand what in the world it was that I just witnessed.  Never in my 48 years have I seen anything in the sky that I couldn't explain. \n \nFor the past few days in my spare time I've been driving around the area directly under where I observed the light trying to explain this off as something normal.  There are no high mountain roads for it to have been car headlights, and I believe the object behind the light was too big to be a civilian (toy) drone. \n \nThis object was in my view for exactly 5 minutes.  It made no sound at all, never changed speed or color, and never diverted from its flight path before I lost sight of it.  As far as size is concerned, I'm guessing that it was equivalent to the size of a private Cessna style plane, but possible a little bigger.  The trees that I observed the object flying over are approximately 50-60 feet high, putting the height of the object in flight at about 75-100 feet. \n \nLastly, I scanned the sky that Sunday morning in all directions until 7:20am, trying to relocate whatever it was that I witnessed.  I've also checked the same area of sky from 5:30am until 7am the following Monday and Tuesday mornings only to find nothing out of the ordinary.", "posted": "2016-01-08T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.641400000000004", "city_longitude": "-77.72563146067415", "latitude": 39.6414, "longitude": -77.725631460674151 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.725631460674151, 39.6414 ] } },

Behind the crows, passed a 'dirty' white light. Light was cigar shaped and appeared to be some distance away [estimate 2-3 miles] at approx 20 degrees above the horizon. Weather was mostly clear with some low morning haze rapidly burning off. Light was first seen to the ESE and traveled noiselessly in a straight line at a constant altitude to the SW. As it traveled, the light seemed to elongate and contract slightly. Sun was at the wrong angle to be causing that much reflection. Light was 'dirty' or muted white not shiny as if relected off of metal. Without taking my eyes off the light, I shouted for a co-worker to come to the door. Before she arrived the light emitted [ejected a better word] a second object. Second object looked exactly like a star at night. Compared to the large light it was just a pinpoint of bright light. 2d object left the first to the rear or in the opposite direction from the flight path of large light. Small lights path was initially approx 45 degrees downward but arcing horizontally and flattening out before I lost sight of it in the treetops across the road. 2d objects rate of speed was very much greater than the large light's speed. Large light did not seem to pause or slow as it ejected 2d light. Co-worker arrived, I pointed out large light and she said \"What in the world is that\" Light shortly disappeared in the haze to the south southwest without ever changing direction or altitude. Hard to estimate size, speed or distance to light as there were no distinguishing features to judge scale. Guessing 2-3 miles distant at 5-10,000 feet altitude. At that distance, the size of the light would have been approx the same as an commercial passenger jet fuselage but had it been a jet I would have heard it at that distance. Very possible it could have been more distant thus larger, higher and faster. Estimate speed at 1000+ mph but this would be very dependent on actual distance from me to object. Would simply classify speed as \"rapid\".

It might have been 1983, but I am pretty sure that I had just completed my first year of college and I have a vague memory of feeling irresponsible about missing too many days of work at my part-time job. I have to admit that I can't pin this down exactly. I know it happened no earlier than 1982 and no later than 1984. There were green leaves on the trees; the temperature was neither particularly hot nor cold. \n \n I had a close friend who was several years younger. I think I was 19-20 years old, so she was 16 or 17. Her father was a boy scout troop leader, and he, her mother, and other adults were taking their troop camping at Swallow Falls State Park, near Oakland, Maryland. (Here is the url for more information: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/western/swallowfalls.html.) She was a bit of a problem teen, and there was no way that her parents were going to let her stay home alone while they took the troop to Swallow Falls. She had to go, but they told her that she was allowed to bring a friend. She asked me and I agreed to go along. \n \n Looking at the Swallow Falls camping maps, I believe that we camped in the Youth Group Loop. I’m not sure exactly where on the loop we were positioned (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/msfmap.html), but my gut tells me we were in camp site number 2 (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/sfyg.html). I am sure that no one was in camp site 3, but I am not clear if any one was in camp 1. I have no recollection of seeing any other campers outside our party during the entire trip. \n \n The camping loop went fairly deep into the forest of huge old trees. On the first night, there was a heavy rain storm. My friend and I were sleeping on the ground in a small two-man tent. We were utterly miserable; our tent was damp and leaking. It kept raining into the next day, and in fact, by the evening, it was absolutely pouring. We decided to spend the night in her father's car. It was parked facing the loop road, next to the encampment. My friend, who was a tiny person, took the backseat, and I planned to sleep in the driver's seat in recline. \n \n I recall that we sat in the car talking for hours while the rain pounded the car. I don’t remember thunder or lightning, just driving rain and some winds. I don’t think the car had a lighted clock. (Now that I think about it, I’m not sure cars had lighted clocks in the early 1980s.) But I guess it was around midnight. \n \n At some point while we conversed, I noticed a light through the front windshield.  I can remember that it illuminated the hard streaks of rain hitting the glass. \n \n We both stopped talking, so I assume that she also saw the light. I never turned my head to look at her in the back seat as the light wended its way toward us. It was yellow-greenish and about as bright as a car headlight pointed full on very bright. It did not have a defined shape because of this brightness, but I assume its core was round. It moved smoothly, about 3-5 feet from the ground, swerving gently a few times to avoid trees. I remember wondering whether it was a car on the muddy loop coming from camp 1. Then I thought, \"Maybe it’s someone walking with a really bright lantern.\"   \n \nMy last memory of the light is as it reached the front of our car.  I retain an image of it crossing in front of us, as if it was going to follow the loop out of the woods to the parking area.  But I can’t recall it actually doing that.  I think I saw it start to illuminate the tents that were to my right.  \n \nThe next thing I remember is disorientation then turning around to my friend to say, \"That was weird.\" The two of us immediately picked up our conversation from before the light appeared. \n \n After that night in the woods, I didn’t think about the odd light for years. I don’t recall ever mentioning it to anyone until the early 1990s, when I read a description of ball lightning.  How it can glide and make unusual maneuvers. I decided that was what we had seen and mentioned it to my husband and friends. \n \n When I was in my 30s, my friend visited from Arizona, where she then lived. I asked her if she remembered that night in the car. She did, except for the light. In her memory, we sat in the car talking in the driving rain until we fell asleep. \n \n Now, after another decade of consideration, I’m no longer sure what I saw was ball lightning and lean more toward a UFO-type experience or that I am simply misremembering an event with a rational explanation: a car; a camper. \n \n I have to rule out it was a vehicle for several reasons. First, there was only one light, not two, although I concede it could have been a car with one headlight. But I don’t remember a car. Second, the only source for a car would have been camp site 1. From where I sat, site one would have been at approximately 1 o’clock. I would have been at roughly 7 o’clock. My memory is of the light coming toward us from about 10 o’clock, out of the woods. I don’t remember seeing camp site 1 occupied. If it was, and this was a car from that site, why would they drive the long way around the unpaved, muddy loop in the storm to exit into the parking area?  Was it a person with a lantern? It might have been someone armed with an incredibly bright light, but I don’t remember a person. I’ve wondered if it was someone from camp site 1 walking to the toilets. I personally have no memory of the bathhouse that is shown on the youth group loop detail, however, a site 1 camper would again be taking a very long route to get to the toilets, through driving rain on a muddy trail. \n \n I also wonder about the disorientation I felt. I don’t know exactly what time it was when the light appeared, so I don’t know if we were missing time, but something felt wrong. I also wonder why my friend and I never discussed it, and why I barely recalled the incident until I read the description of ball lightning years later. I don’t remember any other experiences that could be construed as abductions. Perhaps they were coming for her? We had a falling out in the late 1990s and no longer are in touch or I’d ask her if she has had further experiences. Aliens? A one-headlight car? Another camper? Ball lightning? I don’t know what I saw that night and I never will, I suppose. It’s been bothering me so much recently that I thought I should file a report. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

It was on the C&O Railroad with the C&O canal, tow path and Potomac river within a short walk.  It was an amazing place to spend many years as a child.  It was surrounded by orchards and the Tow Path from Washington, D.C., to the Paw Paw Tunnel was our personal playground. \n \nThere were five children and two grown ups that lived together. Every child had their own room in this 31 room mansion.  All the children with rooms on the east side of the house saw a cigar shaped craft one night hover over an old ornamental fountain in the yard and suck water from it.  The next morning at the breakfast table they all drew pictures of the craft.  It was cigar shaped with orange windows in it. \n \nThat morning the headline in the local news paper reported many people seeing strange lights above Lovers Leap which was a historical sight directly across the Potomac from the mansion in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia. \n \nWe all had chores and that night mine was to feed the cats out on the patio.  The doors that lead out to the patio were french doors with a broken door nob.  If the door latched behind you, you would need to use a near by screw driver to open it.  It was a large screened in patio with terracotta tile floors.  We were hippies and had stuff all over the place including a mini fridge in one of the corners.  I went out to feed the cats and on my way back to the door I felt terror up my back.  I turned around to see a small being standing next to the minifridge with a look of fear on her face.  She was crouched with her hands clasped in front of her torso.  I knew she was a she.  And I knew she was as afraid as I was, like she was caught.  She was glowing amber, stood no taller than the mini fridge and looked exactly like the grays from Close and Encounters of the Third Kind but was much shorter and glowing amber. I was stunned and full of terror.  With container of cat food in one hand I pushed on the latched french door to run inside.  Without considering it had latched shut my hand went through the window as the door slammed open.  I skidded along the floor and ended up in a small pile of glass and dry cat food.  In the chaos I had sliced the palm of my right hand on the broken window and was bleeding pretty bad. \n \nNo one believed me.  Everyone thought I was copying the other children who saw the craft. \n \nI hope that little biological entity found her way home.  The scar on my right palm is my proof of that experience.  This experience opened me to a life spent researching and reading about UFO's and ancient mysteries. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My husband and my friend stood facing myself and his bestfriend. We were outside because I do not allow smoking in the house and it was rather cold so I was standing part way in the door way to keep warm.

Thinking it was just a small aircraft because we are so close to the airforce base I payed no mind until it was right in between the trees in the back yard it flashed a huge round bright light and then appeared to be gone. I yelled what the hell was that and the person beside me had seen it to and we were in amazement and didint know what to make of it. The two that had not seen it passed it off as a meteor or a large fire display of some kind. But seeing the pattern it flew in, It was coming over the woods to the north of us and seemed to speed up Flash and then disapear.

My wife and I live on the third and top floor of a large two bedroom apartment building in Landover. It was a Thursday night and I was working on three articles I write for a trade publication that was to be laid out the next day. I was in the smaller bedroom, which we have turned into a home office/guest room, on the computer. My wife was in the living room watching wrestling, which came on at 8 p.m. and ran til 10 p.m. I had been writing for what I felt to be about an hour when I just got \"the willies\" or whatever. Then the computer froze up. I got it going again and recovered all my data, saved it and suddenly felt very tired. I decided to finish my work at work tomorrow and I went out to watch television with my wife. When I sat down the wrestling program, which runs for two hours, was going off. I told my wife that I hadn't realized I had worked for so long. She said I had! only been working for about an hour and that it was only about 9 p.m. and she didn't know why wrestling would be going off after only showing three matches, which she named and described in detail. I checked our digital phone and it said 10 p.m. I also checked our clock radio and computer. They all said 10 p.m. I went to a website about the wrestling program and it detailed several matches that night and her descriptions were of the first two matches and the last one. I let it go because she scares easily and we both had a real bad case of the creeps that night and weren't sure why. We were really, really exhausted however and fell right to sleep, hard. I have read up on \"missing time\" and this seems to fit all the descriptions. Also, right after the incident I developed a lump under the skin between my left thigh and genital area. I have an appointment to have it looked at  next Monday.

It moved at different speeds could stop on a Dime. \n \nThis day while traveling home on 295 S from Baltimore to Bladensburg I looked in the sky when I was around exit I 197 and saw a bright object in the sky shaped like a football.  It was leaning to the right as if it was in the kickoff position.  It looked as if it was the smoke of a plane but the definition was too detailed on both ends. And the smoke never got dense from the air.  It was 350000 feet and was huge in size. It was as if you could see through the lines of smoke.  It stayed still and did not move.  I called my wife on my cell phone and told her what I was seeing.  I told her it is not moving. Then it moved staight down after I had watched it for 5 to 10 minutes. I lost sight of it because of the trees by the highway.  So I hung up on the cell with my wife and told her I would call her if I seen it again.  Miraculously, when I got near to my exit to get off I seen it right in fron of the place where we live.  I quickly called my wife and told her to look out the window and tell me what she sees. She saw it and was amazed.  I told her to keep an eye on it until I got home because I was almost there. When I got to the front of the apartment where we stay, she was on the balcony of the 8th floor watching the object.  She told me it had just went out of view.  She descibes a CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT, very bright luminus object, speeding up and then slowing down in mid air before going out of view.  I know it was not from here because we saw this object from different angles and I contend it was shaped like a football and she saw a Cigar shaped object from the 8th floor apartment.  With these two calculations I contend that the object was a disk shaped object that moved unlike anything we had ever seen in our lives.  It is almost unexplainable what we saw.  This was the real thing.  I first reported this incident on a sight called LUNA but the sight is now gone and it disappeared 1 day after I reported it on that sight.

Characteristics: There were lights on the object", "report_link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/069/S69012.html", "text": "Three anomalous stationary lights over Bowie for over an hour. \n \nAt 0505 EST I went out on my balcony for my morning cigarette before getting ready for work. My balcony is on the second floor with a southwest-facing view. This was early morning so the sky was very dark and the conditions were calm and clear. As I looked to my far right I saw three lights in the sky. One white light was on the left and to the right were two white lights fairly close together. The two lights on the right were both strobing in regular frequency, but never disappearing between strobes. The three lights maintained the same distance between each other giving the impression that they were all connected. There are normally many aircraft in the sky and my location is within the southeast approach to Baltimore-Washington International Airport. I can also see planes on approach to Andrews Air Force Base to my southwest. \n \n My immediate reaction was that this was a C-17 Globemaster (which I have seen on approach to Andrews from my office outside the Beltway) banking very slowly away from me on approach to Andrews. As I continued to watch the lights however, they appeared to be stationary and at a slight angle – the left light maybe 15 degrees lower than the two right lights. I am familiar enough with aircraft to know that this is not a conventional landing light configuration for fixed-wing aircraft and deduced that a fixed-wing aircraft would also not bank indefinitely. There were no red or green navigation lights also making me suspicious that this was not a fixed-wing aircraft. With the distance between the left and right-side lights at approx. 150-200 feet, I deduced that this was also too large to be a helicopter. I estimate the horizontal distance of the lights from my position at about 2-3 miles at an altitude of about 1,000 feet. The configuration and position of the lights never changed; the two lights on the right continued to strobe in regular frequency. I continued to watch the lights for 20 minutes – never changing formation. I hopped in the shower and got ready for work. I was looking forward to daylight so that I might get a better view of any mass associated with the lights. \n \n After getting ready for work approximately 40 minutes later (60 minutes total), I returned to the balcony to find the lights exactly as they had been – same three lights, same angle, same formation, and same strobing. At this point it was now 0605. I left the house and drove across Route 301 to the gas station to fill up. The lights were still in the sky and daybreak was setting in. I proceeded in my car heading westbound on Route 50. As I looked out the driver’s-side window, I noticed that the lights were in front of me on my left-hand side (southwest). At this point daylight was setting in and I could make out grey mass associated with the lights, however, driving in 80 mph rush hour traffic meant that I had to pay attention to the road and I lost visual. While I thought this might have been a large blimp such as the Skyship 600, this was inconsistent with the grey mass which appeared more cigar-shaped from my cursory observation. When I arrived at work, close to Route 50 and the Beltway, I looked in the general direction from my office and was unable to see the lights. \n \n After discussing the incident with a couple of co-workers I conducted an online search for “lights over Washington DC” thinking perhaps others might have reported witnessing the same event. I came across the incident report on ufocasebook.com from October 26, 2005. This report shared similarities with my experience in terms of number of lights and formation. They were able to get close enough to see a Blackhawk helo along with two lights and witnessed vertical and horizontal movement. I did not witness any movement at all and while I did see grey mass associated with the lights, I was unable to make any concise determination as to shape while driving down the highway. \n \n When I arrived home that evening, I plotted the trajectory from my balcony in the direction of the lights (which obviously were no longer there) based on the corner of a Kohl’s department store across the street. The trajectory caught me off guard seeing as it crossed from the southeast side to the northeast side of Route 50 – I thought it would have been southwest. While driving down Route 50 on my way to work I witnessed the lights on my left (southwest of my position). I also did a little local research to see if any strange events were reported in the media. Well, something did happen the previous night (Feb 26) at 2200 hrs. An 81 car train carrying coal had derailed in a residential area of Bowie. In the derailment, 13 cars had skipped the tracks and tipped over including the locomotive. The incident is almost consistent with my trajectory of where the lights had been. However, the derailment occurred on the NORTH side of Highway 50, while I witnessed the lights on the south side of Highway 50. If this was a series of helicopters, how were they able to stay stationary in perfect formation for over an hour? Why would they be so high in the sky if they were monitoring an accident? And why would they hover over a residential area for that long that early in the morning? It just doesn’t add up for me. \n \n I have no idea what the anomalous lights were. If there is some type of aircraft that does have this lighting configuration I would really like to know. So far, I have no answers. \n \n Thank you for your time and consideration. \n \n", "posted": "2009-03-19T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "38.95170037878788", "city_longitude": "-76.76210984848485", "latitude": 38.951700378787883, "longitude": -76.762109848484855 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.762109848484855, 38.951700378787883 ] } },

It was a dark, clear night. Looking almost straight down at the city lights, I saw a circular object on or near the ground, unmoving. It seemed to be internally illuminated with segments of red, yellow and green light which were spinning slowly clockwise. I estimated its size as about forty feet. As I watched, it suddenly turned bright white and simultaneously shot off to the North at a speed of around 600 knots. In a few seconds it was miles ahead of my aircraft and climbing through my altitude. I pointed it out to my copilot and we watched as it arced out over the sea and disappeared in the distance at a great height. The total time of the sighting was maybe twelve seconds. I continued North to Baltimore and made a left-hand circle around the city, then headed back to the South. As the city lights were falling behind, my copilot slapped my arm and said, \"Did you see that?\" I hadn't seen anything. He said a white light had dived past our right wing very closely at high speed. We looked around but saw nothing. \n \nA few minutes later the radio came alive with chatter about a plane crash near Bowie. We heard no more that night. The next morning I went back to the base to file a report, as we were required to in those days. No one ever contacted me about the report. Then I read an item in that day's Washington Post about a false report of a crash. I quote it here: FAKE REPORT STIRS AIR CRASH HUNT A false report of a plane down near Bowie, Md. led more than 500 police, fire and military authorites on a two-hour search last night. Minutes after the report, 28 state police cruisers, an additional 11 Park Police units and dozens of fire and rescue squads from eight counties joined in the search. The report originated with a caretaker at the Womens' Reformatory at Jessup. State Police said that military units on night maneuvers had probably shot off flares, leading to the report, state police said. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date may be precise, given that it may be from an U. S. military flight log book.   We have met the individual who submitted this report, and we deem him to be an exceptionally credible witness.  He is a former fighter (F-86) and bomber (B-25) pilot, and a former military officer, who was assigned to the Pentagon.  Our impression is that it would be extremely difficult to find a more reliable, credible, and convincing witness.  This is one of several sightings the same individual has had, and those reports will appear in our database, as well, at a later date.

Then with a flash of light they dissiperd. all except for one wich lingerd there for a moment flashing its lights as if it was trying to communicate with me. when it was doing this i didn't feel scared but rather safe in an un-homely way. Then just like the others it went away in a flash! I still remained still and then wen't inside and started to feel things i've never felt befor like a new part of me had just ben awaken. And then I found myself going to this site as if i've always known where it was. Now i am writting this! \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by a young student.

This object was moving at a  slower speed than most satellites (I estimate it would have taken 20 minutes to cross the sky, instead of 4-6); but it was not on the correct orbital track for timing or part of the sky, etc. according to Heavens-above.com which has orbital data for most objects. Several thorough searches have yielded nil. \n \nThe light moved in a straight path from my field of view, and did not change in brightness, which may have indicated a change in altitude. The object appeared to be at an incredibly high altitude, which is why we thought that it must be a satellite, since even aircraft that are visible in binoculars would be in restricted airspace for this part of the sky.

Overhead to my left I saw a jet coming in the opposite direction from the area of the Academy.  I supposed it to be a commercial jetliner as there are many which fly in that path on their way to BWI (Baltimore Washington International Airport).   There were two white lights on either wingtip and one blue blinking one in the center as well as lights on the front.   It seemed to be flying rather low and unusually slowly, so I kept my eye on it.   When it slowed almost to a standstill, I knew something was not normal.  I broke my gaze just long enough to pull to the curb.   With the car in park I glanced over my shoulder and saw the craft just hovering in place. \n \n  Jets don't stand in one place or they'd drop from the sky, (Harriers excepted), and it was too large for a helicopter.   Besides I had the window open and it was completely silent.   I was able to look more carefully now and saw that the front end was well lit; in fact the nose seemed to be composed entirely of glass panels reminiscent of some WWII bombers.   It was floating about a hundred feet up and was not large, maybe forty to sixty feet across.   I could not make out the exact shape, was it triangular, or fusalage and wings?   I did see that it was painted black. \n \n  I was straining to see if I could observe anything through the glass panels when it began to move again.   It floated slowly at first, perhaps ten miles per hour, then picked up a little more speed.   My window was open as I said, and it made no sound.   I started my engine and turned the car around in an effort to pursue the craft. \n \n  It was traveling exactly west in a straight line at level altitude.   The speed limit on the road there is 30mph, so it easily pulled away from me and disappeared beyond a stand of trees though it was not moving very fast.   It was out of view for a few seconds by the time my road went over U.S. Interstate 50.   I paused on the bridge and took a look down along Route 50.   There was no sign of it anywhere.   Had it turned north before reaching the highway?   That would mean it was over the Severn River. \n \n  I turned around again and went along my original route.   A minute or so later I was on the middle of the Naval Academy bridge which spans the Severn.   Again I looked, but the craft was no where to be seen.   I don't know what I saw, but my intuition tells me it was not extra-terrestrial, but one of \"ours\", albeit using an unconventional form of propulsion. \n \n", "posted": "2003-10-17T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "38.982329365079366", "city_longitude": "-76.50591071428572", "latitude": 38.982329365079366, "longitude": -76.505910714285719 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.505910714285719, 38.982329365079366 ] } },

I was to meet some friends to watch the Leonid meteor shower.  After dressing in layers to ward off the chill, I stepped out onto my back balcony to see if I could see any shooting stars.  I saw three almost immediately.  I went in and excitedly phoned my friends - It was going to be great!, I said.  I stepped back out again, not wanting to miss anything.  I saw another shooting star, and then two large, luminous triangles appeared over the houses and trees from the north, headed south.  At first I related the illumination to the meteor shower, but when I looked directly at the objects an instinct kicked in that these were NOT stars, and I was witnessing something incredible. I live a block and a half away from the Naval Academy and I am used to Navy flyovers, Blue Angels, etc.  THIS WAS DIFFERENT.  The triangles did not project light to the ground, they themselves were yellowish, white light. Their edges were not sharp, they were slightly rounded with the glow of the light. The light did not fade or throb, it was constant. They appeared to be flying in formation - points facing down, close together, on a diagonal.  Together, they were about the size of a half moon. Their movenment was fluid and quick and they were SILENT.  My field of view is not very wide out my back porch, so I was only able to watch the objects for 7 seconds or so.  Soon after they disappeared from my view, I heard a boat horn sound twice quickly.  It occurred to me that maybe someone on the water saw the same thing, as the objects were headed in the direction of City Dock.  I met my friends on the back campus of St. Johns.  I told them I was pretty sure I had seen UFOs (a first for me, by the way) and quickly described my experience.  They reacted with friendly skepticism.  We were lying on a blanket, enjoying the wonderful meteor shower when I saw the triangles again in the southeast corner of the sky.  I sat up, pointed, and said \"Look!!!  There they are!!!\"  Thank goodness one friend was ! able to see them.  They were much farther away - about a third of the size they were before, and not as luminous.  They were now reddish orange in color and continued flying quickly in a southeast direction.  Just before they disappeared from our field of view, one triangle broke out of formation and darted ahead.  It was surreal. It seemed as though the triangles were animated - right out of a movie.", "posted": "2001-11-20T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "38.982329365079366", "city_longitude": "-76.50591071428572", "latitude": 38.982329365079366, "longitude": -76.505910714285719 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.505910714285719, 38.982329365079366 ] } },

I couldn't pull over at that time because there was a car to my right (as you can see in the picture) and my exit was coming up fast. Once I made my exit, I pulled over and got out, but it was gone.  \"This is too good to be true, I guess I can't get a better, second shot\", I thought.  It's definitely not a weather balloon, because the way this thing moved and at the speed it moved, it's just not possible.

I saw a fast moving object flashing, with a fairly regular pattern of two flashes in less than a quarter second, then a gap of about three quarters of a second.   \n \nAfter observing a first pair of flashes, I concluded that the object was a fast moving airplane.  However, when the next pair of flashes began less than a second later, the object was moving in a completely different direction, perhaps about 135 degrees off from its original heading.  It didn't seem possible for an airplane to turn so quickly and completely. \n \nThe flashing light continued this rapid darting behavior, changing its heading seemingly almost at random with each pair of flashes.  After seeing each pair of flashes, I could roughly guess where the next would appear, but the position and particularly the heading would always surprise me somewhat when the next pair of flashes occurred.  It gave the impression of a pinball being bounced rapidly around by bumpers. \n \nOver the course of about 90 seconds, the object bounced its way to the West, and finally over to the Southern sky, where I lost it behind some trees.  There was no sound at any time. \n \nI watched the sky closely for about 30 minutes thereafter, and I spotted the light twice more, after roughly five minutes intervals.

I pulled into my driveway and exited my car.  I walked down to the front of my house and observed four, disk shaped airborne objects, stacked one on top of the other.

The fog or smoke had cleared.  I saw no observable means of thrust or propeller to keep the objects afloat or for their movement.  The objects were about 30-50 feet above the ground.  They seemed to be able to sit in the air without any observable! means of support.  Once in formation, the three objects in the “V” moved very slowly in a southeast direction, to my left.  After a few seconds, the fourth object began to move forward as well.  (It looked as if the one object was guarding the other three objects in the “V” formation.

The street was wet, but there was no standing or pooled water in the area, no lightening, and very little wind at that time. \n \n The object did not appear to be self-luminous (which was probably good, because we could see surface details that could have been concealed by lights) but was very well lighted not only by my car's headlights but by a street light which was directly above the general area. \n \n The bi-convex disc (a color illustration is provided, but it only shows the object edge-on)looked to be made of maybe some hybrid type material that reminded me of nothing so much as tan rock with light gray coloration on the flat top of the disc, which disc also has a flange on both sides, but a flat bottom.  The flange on the top was thicker than that on the bottom. \n \n On both the top and bottom flanges, one could see distinct and slightly inset grooves, evenly spaced like approximately 1/8-inch successive layers of a geological substrate, as if the thing were either constructed in layers or else had some kind of coils (one above the other)upon or just beneath the surface! I have pretty effectively illustrated these in the rendering provided, but have not attempted to illustrate the peripheral planes of successive small, dark 'dots' that actually looked somewhat recessed, in various planes around the thing.  The reason I have not tried to render those dots in the illustration is because I am not absolutely sure whether those recessed dots were between the recessed peripheral grooves (which are illustrated) or actually within them.  I think the later was the case, but just am not sure,  because it all happened so fast. \n \n Anyhow, once the disc (which traveled only about 1/4 to 1/2 inch above the street in a most wonderfully smooth gliding motion resembling an ice hockey puck sliding on ice) came to what may have been the exact middle of the street, and without slowing down (just as the 'textbook' UFO), it immediately was suddenly going the same speed in the opposite direction(!), taking it right back across in front of our car (which was stopped or nearly stopped at that point)for a second-chance view. \n \n When the bi-convex disc reached the curb (at the same place it had suddenly appeared), it just as suddenly vanished right before our eyes!  So, I accelerated up to the nearby intersection, made a fast U turn, and went back, to see if we could see the thing again, or some trace of it, but nothing was found.  No cars with occupants were seen in the area just before, during, or just after the encounter,  but that is not surprising in that residential neighborhood on a rather rainy night. \n \n We heard no sound that we associated with the object.  We felt no electrical sensations or unusual heat or cold, either.  The car engine did not fail, and there was no missing time. \n \n The whole thing was so bizarre that we are still in wonderment about the nature of what was observed.  I do not expect to ever figure that one out.  Whatever it was, it just should not have been there. Was it flying?  Well, yes, incredibly smoothly and close to the street.  The thing showed no pitch, yaw, or roll, whatsoever.  It would not be so troubling had we not seen it so very clearly, in good lighting from our headlights and the street lamp. \n \n I refuse to believe that the thing was a government spy drone of any type, because I doubt we have technology that sophisticated, or even a spy drone that is disc shaped and only six inches in diameter. \n \n I later parked the car in the street and adjusted the position of a white six-inch  ruler laid on the street until it was the same observational elevation above the edge of my car's hood as the bi-convex disc had been, and the six-inch ruler looked the same angular width as the disc when at 15 feet from the car. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ray Stanford, a noted UFO investigator, for submitting this report.

What my wife and I saw this morning was something other than a \"craft\", I suspect, yet it was quite bizarre.  It involved a 'something' shaped exactly like a vertically oriented Greek letter omega, complete with the small 'wing' out to each side at the bottom.  The 'thing' seemed composed of a very solid-looking tube with pointed ends that was of a bright white, opaque-looking, and highly coherent 'vapor' (or something else). It subtended about four full moons or two degrees in height (somewhat less in width), as measured objectively by my wife using fingers at arm's length, and by me, independently. \n \n The Omega-like thing hovered at about 42 degrees elevation in our north-northwestern sky while a brand-new-looking (very clean, bright paint) blue and white helicopter circled several times between us and it at only a couple of hundred feet (maybe 300-400 maximum) just to the east and southeast of the 'thing', until the thing suddenly began to disintegrate or dissolve as a white vapor that was quickly carried away to the east on low-level winds that were the same as at ground level. Then, the helicopter flew off. \n \n It was the extraordinarily noise of the low-level, circling (in a N-S oval) helicopter (that had just flown into the area) that caused my wife and me to look up in its direction and, as a result, see the bizarre omega-shaped thing hovering what seemed, subjectively, no more that a thousand feet to the northwest of the elliptical path of the helicopter. \n \n The helicopter departed once the 'omega' began to disintegrate, after having completed several traverses of its elliptical path. \n \n I have subsequently learned the identity of the helicopter and the name of its pilot, plus the phone number were I should be able to reach him early in the morning (Saturday). Anything I learn from the pilot will be relayed to you. \n \n I would stress that this definitely was not a jet aircraft's condensation wake, nor was it an ordinary low-level cloud, by any stretch of the imagination.  Whatever it might have been, it gave the impression of being of artificial, and at least to us, anomalous in origin. \n \n We live just inside the northern edge of the Washington, D.C. Beltway (I 495), and a short drive west of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. \n \n I ran inside to get the camera but could not locate it, so I ran back out while my wife (who had watched in the interim of my absence)went in and found the camera and came back outside with it.  By that time, the object had disintegrated, with the residue drifting east.  I took several photos of the vapor drifting east along with small clouds and trees for reference, in order to show that the residue was drifting on the lower-level wind and not with the atmosphere higher up where jets fly. \n \n The observation was not frightening, but it seemed quite bizarre, that impression enhanced by the elliptically circling helicopter just to the omega's east and southeast, and only while the object was there.  It will be interesting to learn whether the pilot saw the phenomenon, and I have learned the pilot was \"on a photo mission\", so he might even have gotten photos.  I shall not hold my breath, though, because the pilot and anyone else aboard may have been distracted downward because it was a photo mission. If not the observed phenomenon, I wonder what they were trying to photograph in that area.  The photo objective may have been something prosaic, however, although I can't help but hope they saw the phenomenon and took photos. \n \n Within six minutes after the observation, I checked the ELF magnetic environment with one of our instruments, but found nothing magnetically anomalous in the monitored range. \n \n I would judge, subjectively, that the vertically oriented (at least from our view, and seemingly relative to the ground) 'omega' was located approximately over the intersection of the northern side of the D.C. Beltway (I 495) with I 95, going north and south toward and from Baltimore. \n \n It was so windy this morning that I am confident the 'omega' was not 'skywriting', and, furthermore, being just north of D.C. within its beltway, we are in a highly FLIGHT CONTROLLED zone. A skywriting aircraft would have been attacked by the Air Force, immediately.  Furthermore, sky writing would not have hovered in the sky, as did this phenomenon before its 'disintegration'. \n \n I hope no one tries to read anything into the fact that the phenomenon was omega-shaped, even though I could think of some political commentary.  :)", "posted": "2004-07-25T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "38.99623404255319", "city_longitude": "-76.93590425531914", "latitude": 38.996234042553191, "longitude": -76.935904255319144 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.935904255319144, 38.996234042553191 ] } },

At first it was only the white sphere (very clearly outlined), and then , it seemingly suddenly (See below.) 'generated' the strange (seemingly high-speed pulsing at maybe 10-12 Hz) column beneath it. \n \n There was no wobble, pendulation, pitch, or roll that I could detect.  It remained perfectly stable and vertical at all times, while traveling at about ninety degrees to the rather brisk wind.  It made a sharp and substantial change (but a bit less than ninety degrees) in course, suddenly, at about 40% up the vertical component of its course. \n \n It disappeared due to altitude at about 80 degrees elevation in my ~ south-east.  Sphere became brighter as it sped up and with distance, but the electric blue column seemed to keep a constant light level. \n \n Attached are, (1), how it looked before extending the column, and, (2), a version of how the object looked after the electric blue column was extended.  One comment: That drawing of the sphere, alone, does not show the thing nearly as clearly as the actual view I had of it.  The edges were very sharp, and clear as could be -- much sharper than the moon's edge on the clearest of days, because it was so close. \n \n Until the object climbed very high (almost vertically), it was of sufficient angular size as to be seen quite sharply and distinctly.  The white, spherical object had NO COLUMN WHATSOEVER until I took my eyes off it for a moment because a car in the parking lot honked near me, and when I looked back up after only a couple of seconds, the strange column was there!  No camera with me. :(    I'd have gotten some spectacular, sharp  images, otherwise.  At closest, the sphere, per se, subtended at least half a degree (moon or sun angular  size), but as you can see, the electric blue column made its vertically subtended arc larger. \n \n The initial sighting location was a few blocks W-SW of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, and would guess the object made its direction change when it was approximately right over the space flight center. Come to think about it, that would possibly have been what it was over when the electric blue tube beneath the object appeared, but I would caution against any undue speculation about what, if anything, it might have been doing over Goddard.  Of one thing I am certain, it did not come from there, because I am quite familiar Goddard. \n \n I waited, overnight, to report this until the drawings were complete, wanting to make the drawings while while what I saw was very fresh on my mind. \n \n  Ray Stanford \n \n((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Ray Stanford, noted author and UFO investigator, for sharing this report.

At the time, there were no generators on nearby, no traffic sounds coming from the nearby roadways, and no airplane or helicopter sounds--just the sounds of insects and the continuing sounds of what were probably just animals moving in the woods. \n \nWhile laying awake, though, unable to fall back asleep, an unnatural, pulsating, humming sound grew from among the natural sounds I was hearing.

The overwhelming sound continued at this discomforting volume for what I believe was several minutes. \n \nHonestly, I was scared.  I continued laying there in our tent, only looking out the tent's mesh portions we left uncovered for the night breezes and not leaving the tent to actually take a look up or around.  I didn't see anything from inside the tent, but the sound was haunting.  Thankfully, as I thought at the time, the sound receded back into the the more natural sounds of the night, sounding like it had traveled away from the area, and finally leaving me in peace, but unable to fall back asleep for some time. \n \nDuring the entire experience, I had attempted to wake my wife up without being too loud because I didn't want to sound ridiculous.  The following morning, though, she told me she had heard me, but just went back to sleep.  She assured me, however, that she had heard some sort of sound like what I described to her, but in her sleepy state just figured it was a natural, insect-like sort of buzzing.  I've since assured her that it was not.  It was nothing I've heard before, nothing natural, nothing heard any other night during our stay at Greenbelt Park. \n \nI reached out to Greenbelt Park via email after returning home from our long drive, as well as to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center via Twitter.

It did not appear to be moving really fast from our distance, but it circled around the moon I would guess about every 20 seconds.  Knowing how large the moon is, it must have been going VERY fast.

As a child I didn't think much of the inident because kids believe in imaginary stuff like aliens, but as an adult, it seems very strange.

I first contacted the Center for UFO Studies in Chicago in 2006. I am reporting it here because I am still perplexed by what I saw. \n \nIt was a clear Fall evening in Silver Spring, Maryland and I was reading a book in my den.  The window shades were pulled up and the windows were open because it was a relatively warm night.  Above the treeline, I spotted what appeared to be a star or planet that seemed to be unusually bright.  I glanced at the object from time to time between reading the book and listening to my teenage kids who were home at the time.  I grew slightly intrigued by the object because it appeared to be hovering while the other stars seemed fixed in there locations and an occassional plane would fly by in the distance.   I thought it may have been a helicopter but the there were no red lights, blue lights or search beams that I associate with helicopters.  Downtown Silver Spring is an very urban area located 5 minutes from Washington, D.C., so helicopters are not an unusual sight at all. \n \nThe object disappeared below the tree line and re-appeared about two minutes later. I called my then 17-year old daughter and asked her to look out the window and tell me what she saw.  Her first words were, \"what in the world is that?\" She stated that the lights were not like anything ahe had seen.  And, she was right.  The lights were white but had a halo effect that seemed to indicate that they were pulsating. There was a slightly bluish tint to them also. \n \nThe object appeared to be 500 ft above ground level not even a quarter of a mile from the the house.  For 25 minutes I watched it(my daughter did not want to watch it anymore)hover, glide horizontally, rise vertically, but never leave the area.  \n \nSuddenly, it began to glide towards the house (I say glide because it was not flying like a helicopter or a plane.)   \n \nI called my father who lives six blocks away and asked him to go outside a look in the sky and tell me if he saw anything unusual. He said he wasn't sure but there were so many stars out that night.  While I was talking to him the object glided above the corner lot located two houses from our house.  It then glided over my neighbors house at tree-level, probably not three hundred feet above ground.  I was amazed at what I saw.  It was a black triangle about 3/4 the size of a football field. It was definitely a solid object.  It made absolutely no sound at all.  I know this because it passed over my roof while I was outside in my front yard.  Again, it was a very clear night.  It then disappeared, I guess that is way I can describe it but I don't know.  Let's just say that I could not see it anymore.  I called my newsroom and local stations. No reports had been received. \n \nThe next day, I approaced my neighbor and before I could say anything she asked me if I had seen the object.  She stated that she had never seen anything like it and, in fact, she and her friend tried to follow it down our street but it vanished in the sky.  Again, I have no idea what this object was, but it was an experience I will never forget. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was heading towards Potomac from Bethesda or NW DC, and it was nearing my curfew, so somewhere after 11 and before midnight, I believe. As I came out from the underpass (495 crosses over the parkway near here), the Model Basin came into view, as normal. What was not normal: a silvery, blimp or more accurately, burger? chipwich? shaped thing was hovering over the Basin. It appeared to be lit from within, or rather, that it had a luminescence about it. I can't recall any blinking lights, though I recall it had sort of a nubbly shape along the edges, which maybe were lights. It was very large, and terrified teenaged me. I floored it, trying to create as much space as possible between this....craft...and myself. It was super big in the rearview mirror, and it was quiet. I heard nothing, not even the usual chirping crickets or tree frogs that infest the forests along the parkway. As I sped (I drove a thunderbird, and I floored it, I was waaaaay over the speed limit), I anxiously watched it continue to hover. \n \nI know what blimps look like. I know what a lot of jets, ships, planes, fighters, etc look like. I grew up here, and you see a lot of stuff. This was nothing commercial, and wasn't a weather balloon or blimp, though it hovered similarly. It didn't resemble any space shuttle or stealth jet I've seen. It was just...totally foreign to my mind. It's feasible it was some other country's spy tech, but the silence confused me-I still can recall that detail 25 years later. \n \nThe next day or so later, I was talking to a friend about it while we got coffee. A woman approached me and stated she'd spotted it as well, and called it in (not sure who she called, but she reported it) and was informed it was a weather balloon.

Its motion and appearance were just that, but it was almost midnight, and the light passed nearly overhead and to the southwest until it became invisible behind clouds near the Southwest horizon. Planes nearly always exhibit strobes, are only orange colored when near the horizon, and without exception look a lot different as they change their aspect angle with respect to the observer, and this light didn't.  I checked the time on my cell phone, and it was 23:58 - nearly midnight. \n \n The sun was just about at +7 degrees declination. From that, I calculate that altitude would have to have been about 2500 km to be visible overhead at local midnight from my location (about 39 deg N). A large rocket body in transfer orbit might well be at such an altitude, but I don't think it could be that bright at that slant range (roughly 3700 km or more at first), or that consistently orangish/yellow. \n \n Since it moved from northeast to southwest, if what I saw was a satellite, it would have to be in a retrograde orbit. There have been quite a few of these, but nearly all are low orbiters, well below 1000 km altitude. \n \nI tried to find a candidate satellite. It would need an apogee altitude of at least 1000 km (more likely 2000 km), and an inclination greater than 90 degrees. This really cuts the list down to about 20 candidates. \n \n There were several potentially visible birds at about that time, but all would have been in the northwest and would not have passed anywhere near overhead while illuminated by the sun.

It was particularly cloudy out, so there were no stars visible in the sky.  As I was approaching New Hampshire Avenue on Bonifant, I saw what I first thought was a star constellation, formed out of bright orange/red circles.  There were five circles in a formation that at first resembled the big dipper, except without the scooper portion of the dipper itself.  The circles seemed lower than the clouds, and a color I have not seen on any aircraft at night. \n \nDuring this time, I called my girlfriend to get her to go outside to see if she could see what I was seeing.  While communicating with her on the phone, I pulled off on a side street just after Notley Road.  I was able to see at this points that the circles were not stationary as they first seemed, but were actually moving.  I'm not sure if they were moving the whole time or not, but I traveled a relatively short distance before noticing them moving, so I feel that I would have noticed them prior to pulling off on the side street.  Once on the side street, I drove up a little ways, and seemed to be directly under the 5 orange circles, still spaced a pretty good distance apart, best compared to the spacing of looking at the stars that form the big dipper.  I turned onto a second neighborhood street to follow the direction they were moving, all the while talking to my girlfriend, aside from one call to my brother, to see if he could see them as well, but to no avail. \n \nThe second neighborhood street was a culdesac, so I turned around the circle, at which point I noticed two to three new circles of the same size and color, and at what appeared to be an equal spacing as the previous five from the previous five.  They appeared to be moving in the same direction as the first five that I witnessed. \n \nThese crafts appeared to be lower to the ground than the storm clouds, as stars were not visible due to the clouds.  After this point, I made a point to try to observe airplanes in the area to compare to what I saw.  These circles were different in that you couldn't gather a distinctive shape, whereas sometimes with a jet you can pick up multiple lights in different parts of the craft, or perhaps even an outline of the jet.  Usually if it's a jet, you can at least make out the shape of the craft until a point where it gets so high in the sky, that it appears to be like a moving star sized object.  These circles appeared to be two to three times the size of a jet that is high up in the sky and resembling a moving star, but notably lower to the earth.  They appeared to be moving quickly, and I was unable to discern any shape to the craft, even right I turned onto the side street and was directly beneath them. \n \nI'm not sure what to make of this.  I'm an open-minded person, but this was quite alarming to me for a number of reasons.  I have never seen jets or planes with lights of this color, brightness and size.  It was a bright, single solid orange color for each of the dots.  Additionally, because of the storm clouds, these stood out on the sky well apart from stars since stars were hardly visible.  Thirdly, they appeared to be stationary prior to moving.", "posted": "2011-01-05T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.04649342105263", "city_longitude": "-77.0290407894737", "latitude": 39.046493421052631, "longitude": -77.029040789473697 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.029040789473697, 39.046493421052631 ] } },

I knew this because they touched me in places I'd rather not share.  They stuck a needle in me but for some reason I felt no pain.  In the backround there were more people that appeared to be the female versions of the people.  The people talked in a foreign language that could not be understood.  It was a series of clicks and mumbled speech.  The room grew cold and I felt something being pulled out of me.  My apendix I believe.  Then I was knocked out once again.

D.C. I awoke about 3:30am because I had to go to the bathroom but didn't get up immediately. As I lay there, I was on my left side facing a large double window a few feet away. As I lay there a large triangular craft passed over the roof of my unit passing over the roof of the the units directly across the courtyard from where I was and then I lost sight of it. I would estimate the altitude of this craft to be no more than five-hundred feet and it was traveling in a north-easterly direction. It was moving slowly and I estimated the speed to be in the neighborhood of thirty-five miles per hour, give or take. I didn't make any sound that I could detect. I would estimate the size of the craft to be about three-hundred feet on a side; maybe a little larger. \n \nAlthough this happened in the middle of the night, the sky does not get really dark here because of all the lighting in the area so I saw the craft fairly well. It appeared to be flat-black against the lighter sky and there were low intensity lights at the points of the triangle. There were no visible windows that I could see but I only had a view of the bottom of the craft. The best way I can describe the movement is that it appeared to just slide effortlessly across the sky rather than fly as would a conventional aircraft. I told one other person who lives in the community about the incident but I could tell I wasn't believed so I kept it to myself. I would have reported the incident to a Government agency but I know how that would go so I didn't bother. I can state that this craft did not depend on air moving over the surface to keep it airborne because it was traveling far too slow for that to be a factor.

I should say that I'm a college student who has studied Astronomy throughout high school and college, so I feel I'm a pretty observant person. \n \n Last Saturday, February 19th, at around 2:35 PM, I was sitting at a traffic light when I just decided to look up at the sky since it was such a gorgeous day, not a cloud in sight whatsoever.  I looked over to my left, which would be looking north, when I noticed an object in the sky at about 45 degrees elevation to my line of sight.  It was greyish in color and cigar-shaped, and was traveling at quite a brisk pace; if I had to estimate the speed in relation to a car on the ground, I would say about 30 miles per hour.  If I had to estimate the size of the object, I would say it was about the diameter of a quarter if held at arm's length.  I would estimate the elevation to be 500 feet above the ground at the most.  If memory serves me right, this would make this a right isosceles triangle, meaning that the distance on the ground between myself and the object was about 500 feet.  I feel this is about right.  The object also seemed to be \"hazy\" - it would best be related to heat fog that one sees when looking down a tarmac road on a hot day. \n \n When I first noticed the object, it was traveling west, parallel to the direction my car was facing at the traffic light.  I was looking out to the north, and my car was facing the east.  I was intrigued by it because it was definitely not a helicopter, because it was flat, and did not have any rotar blades.  I see a lot of helicopters in this area, and even if they are as far away from me as this one was, I can hear noise, but this made no sound.  I got the impression that it was not way far away in the distance, but was close.  After watching it for several seconds, I looked ahead to see if the traffic light had changed, and upon seeing that it was still red, I looked back to where the object was traveling, where it should have been had it continued along the same path, only to find that it was gone.  Just gone.  Surprised, I looked around the sky intently, thinking that it might have changed direction.  I still could not find it, and I never saw it again. \n \n The object was traveling in the middle of the sky when I noticed it, and I only took my gaze away from it for 2 seconds, so I have no idea where it could have gone in that time if it really was just a plane or helicopter.  I spent the next 15 seconds before the traffic light changed looking all over the sky, just in case it had disappeared due to the sun's reflection, but I still could not find it.  I would argue this was possibly a conventional airplane, except I cannot get over the fact of how a conventional aircraft could disappear that fast.  There were no trees it could have disappeared behind, nor any cloud cover. \n \n", "posted": "2005-02-22T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.070945406824144", "city_longitude": "-77.14350236220473", "latitude": 39.070945406824144, "longitude": -77.143502362204728 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.143502362204728, 39.070945406824144 ] } },

As a preface, I do not drink or smoke, and although I was a little tired when this took place, I was looking out the window simply out of curiosity.  While I'm interested in UFOs, on the whole I have generally been a skeptic in this field.  Sometimes I have seen objects that I think are unusual, but it turns out to be a plane or a planet.   \n \nThis was different given the motion of the object and the clarity.  Being the Fourth of July, I also thought a rogue firework might be behind this, but the object was visible for 20-30 minutes, moved with purpose, and was soundless. \n \nI noticed a green light which was pulsating at regular intervals, hovering several miles away without moving.  I thought this was a helicopter, but it was unusual because the light was blinking green (no other colors) and wasn’t moving. \n \nAs it so happened, a plane/helicopter flew by as I was watching this object, and there were a few main differences easily apparent -   \n \n1.)  The plane moved in a linear direction. Helicopters, when seen, generally do too.  This object was stationary. \n \n2.)  The plane had a blinking white tail light, along with red and green running lights. The object I was seeing had neither. \n \n Shortly after the plane passed, the object ascended rapidly and stopped. I thought this was odd because usually helicopters will gather momentum as they ascend and they’ll stop as they reach their new destination.  This object simply went up and stopped. \n \nI moved to another room with a better vantage point and viewed the object directly for ~15 minutes as it moved occasionally.  The object was located to my south and would have been by my estimation about 4-8 miles away.  It blinked green continuously (no light, green light, no light) at regular intervals.  It moved behind a tree and I believe I saw it flash more rapidly with a pinkish color but I am not certain.  During this time it moved in one direction, stop briefly, then would reverse direction or move in another direction.  Planes and other aircraft curve to meet a path - this moved fairly linearly.  I don’t believe this was a drone as I don’t think I would have been able to see it as far away as it was, given the distance, and it moved past the trees, and moved back to near its original position.   \n \nI attempted to take several photographs and videos of the object, but it is difficult to make out in most. \n \nThe object then moved directly towards me and I saw there were two lights as part of the object. I could not identify a shape of the object but it seemed as though the lights were on the underside, if indeed there was an object.  It passed directly over my residence and hovered there for a second, before moving on.  The lights were bright and there were very clearly two of them, side by side (left-right oriented).  The lights were two large to be running lights on an aircraft, my best analogy is as though someone put two small flashlights together and pointed them down. \n \nI went out my front door to look at it and saw it moving in the reverse direction, but it was silent.  I could still clearly see two green lights.  I estimate it was flying lower than typical small plane but cannot estimate its altitude in feet/meters. \n \nI went to go outside to try to take more footage but as I was doing so, the object went back to its original position, hovered, then moved off to the W-SW.  I was able to capture video of it moving from a stationary camera on a tripod, as well as phone video.  Given the darkness it is difficult to see but the blinking light(s) are visible in these files.  Unfortunately I did not capture the moment that it flew over my location, but it is clearly visible in one photograph that the object had two distinct lights.", "posted": "2017-07-07T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.070945406824144", "city_longitude": "-77.14350236220473", "latitude": 39.070945406824144, "longitude": -77.143502362204728 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.143502362204728, 39.070945406824144 ] } },

I am a college security officer and was out patrolling the campus when I observed a bright light West of me.  At first I assumed it was an airplane with an extremely bright light and I thought to myself ‘that is a really bright light’.  The sky was somewhat cloudy at times but it was clear enough that stars were visible still – more like a hazy/cloudy sky at the time of the sighting.  If one has seen an airplane traveling through clouds before, one would have observed that the headlight is distinct and the light forms a triangular shape; this object I was watching was doing the same thing only it was at least twice as big as a light from an airplane.  Throughout the approximate 2 minutes I watched this light, it began to move South and I thought to myself ‘either that plane is about to crash into me or it is flying dangerously low’.  My assumptions that it was an airplane were backed by 3 flashing red lights beneath it (resembling a planes wingspan).  As it began to turn South from its seemingly stationary position, I thought that it could not be an airplane and that it must be a helicopter.  The only problem is that this made no noise that I could hear what-so-ever (when police helicopters fly anywhere near the campus, they are extremely loud and obvious, unlike what I saw).  As it turned I caught a very clear sight of the actual object on its side in the bright moonlight and at that point I ruled out the possibility of it being a helicopter.   The object most simply described was a large, dark, metallic sphere floating slowly in the air, possibly a few hundred feet above the treetops.  I was unable to assess how large this object was, but from my view, its size was about the same as the moon’s size from my view.  I even considered the possibility that it was some sort of remote controlled toy but it was too big and I thought that it would be ! silly fo r anyone to be playing with something like this at midnight.  It was heading out of my sight and about to be hidden behind a building and large bare trees so I ran to get to the other side of the building to get a better look but I could not find a trace of it anywhere.  I did see what seemed like an airplane traveling very far away in the distance but could not understand how it could have gone that far in a matter of 15 seconds or so.  But I am 100% sure of what I saw; a large sphere-like object with a single intensely bright ‘headlight’ on its side facing a downward angle and at the least 3 red flashing lights on its bottom side. \n \n One housekeeping staff working through the night noticed a bright light in the sky not moving but did not think enough of it to watch it because it was too cold outside.  He went to throw out garbage but on his way back he noticed that it was gone. \n \n One other security officer claims he saw red lights in the clouds above him not moving but did not see the actual object as I did as he drove around in the security truck but did not pay much attention to them. \n \n The duration of time of what I saw was about a total of 2 minutes but I only saw the actual objects body for approximately 10 seconds.  Never in my life have I seen anything that could have been a UFO before today.  It clearly was what I said it was.  While speaking with the housekeeping staff witness inside of a building, we both heard what sounded like a rocket being fired.  An example of this sound is what the fireworks sound like during 4th of July celebrations as they are fired into the air.  But there was no sound following this whistle.  This is possibly unrelated but in my 2 years of working this shift at this job I have never heard anything like this.  After hearing it I ran outside to see if there was something to see but the sky was clear. \n \n", "posted": "2009-03-19T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.070945406824144", "city_longitude": "-77.14350236220473", "latitude": 39.070945406824144, "longitude": -77.143502362204728 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.143502362204728, 39.070945406824144 ] } },

I am, admittedly, interested in the UAP phenomenon. Because of this, I recently purchased a gen 3 night-vision/thermal monocular w video recording capability. I live in the DC/metro area. I am familiar with the appearance of airplanes and helicopters in the sky. Despite light pollution, the monocular does permit me to get a decent view of stars, planets, and the moon. Given atmospheric effects, I am aware that stars can appear to twinkle, and even bounce, around in the sky at times. Again, I understand this perceived movement of stars is not actually occurring. \n \n Since I have owned this night-vision device, I have recorded some interesting sights/sightings of objects in the late night/early morning sky that are not otherwise visible to the naked eye (please note that I am also not able to see any stars, satellites, or most planets without the night vision). Times of occurrences are btw 11pm-3am numerous weekday evenings. Usually, I witness intermittently (.5 of a second or faster apart/btw blinks) blinking objects which move horizontally across the sky at a moderate/swift (not particularly fast) pace. Sometimes they seem to completely disappear (and not reappear, like a star might). Other times, there have been two closely flying pairs of these lights similarly moving horizontally across they visible section of sky somewhat in tandem. There is no real rhyme or reason to when these lights will appear and/or disappear unlike the flow of airplane traffic to/from Dulles or BWI or National Airports. The objects do not have the blinking lights (green and red with white) that are characteristic of FAA type or military aircraft. I can't make out anything other than a blinking light - is the entire object the blinking light? Or is my camera not detecting the body of the craft? I don't know the answer. The distance appears to be a few miles out from my window at least (can't be sure). There is no discernable sound, but, again, I live in a noisey/congested area. I don’t get the impression that these are satellites. My understanding is that most? all? satellites do not blink or emit their own light source. I have tried to do some digging as to the movement of 'cell phone' reception satellites but I have not found much info. Maybe I am witnessing drones, but they do not appear to fly as I might imagine drones to fly. Also, the DC/metro airspace I live under is extremely restricted, so, at the least, they are not private individuals’ drones. In conclusion, I do save my recordings and am more than happy to meet and share these with whomever is interested.

This happened approx in Oct. 1975.  I was 19 years old.  It was in the middle of the night, I was sleeping - I was suddenly aware that I appeared to be outside of my house and looking down at my house, I remember seeing the roof of my house and the street below me, then I saw a silvery side of a disk shaped classic flying saucer - my condition was not at all what I would call normal, I felt I wasnt simply dreaming - it had a very real aspect yet I was sort of out of touch with what was happening, a good description was I felt like a bystander - which is hard to describe or even understand.  I next recall encountering a man, and United States Air Force officer in full uniform, he had black hair and seemed alittle angry - He spoke as an american english, slighly overweight, and was yelling at 'others' later I think I may have said something to this person and he was mad because I was 'awake'? - I seemed to be floated around inside what appeared to be the outer parimeter of this craft and placed on some sort of operating table.   Then I had the awareness that they were performing some sort of brain operation! - this caused me TONS of mental and spiritual discomfort, anguish and FEAR... I felt that during this time I was outside my body and was watching from behind the 'surgeons' - I was incredulous and shocked at this experience wondering AT THAT TIME was this really real? was it really happening?  I recall hearing their voices, but I dont know what they were saying. That seems to be the extent of it, or at least, it is all that I recalled happening.  I 'awoke' the next day fully aware of what I had just experienced and KNEW that there was NO WAY I could EVER reveal this to ANYONE EVER... It was just too incredible.  I was very scared at the whole experience.  This happened in 1975, October.  Years later, when I read Whitely Striber's Communion, I had a terrible shock that this 'dream' may have not been a dream after all, and could have been a real experience, it was one line he inserted in his book at the end of a chapter he said somthing like: 'they implanted something in my brain!'  THAT realization, that my experience may have been TRUE was almost too much for me to handle... I have since reconciled this and wanted to express this and see if there are any others in the area who had similar experiences at that time?

Once again, it was oval/disk shaped highly polished silver on one half and highly polished cherry red color on the other half.  It again, tumbled occassionaly and I was able to see the bright reflection of the 2 halves. \n \nA man who works on the 7th floor was outside and I called to him to come here, hurry.  He came over to me quickly and I pointed to the object in the sky and said, what is that?  He looked and said Oh my goodness what is it?  Is it a ufo?  I said it probably is maybe a probe or some type of spying device.  It made no sound and quickly flew out of our sight.  As an aside, when I drove to work that morning, around 7:55 I saw 2 helicopters flying north following Route 355 in Rockville. \n \n", "posted": "2007-04-27T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.070945406824144", "city_longitude": "-77.14350236220473", "latitude": 39.070945406824144, "longitude": -77.143502362204728 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.143502362204728, 39.070945406824144 ] } },

I was told it was place where high income people shopped.  I was driving on a 4 lane road, with two lanes on either side and grassy area in the middle with trees on either side of the road.  i know i was near a large shopping/metropolitan area.  i was the driver of the car.

Why do I know that all this that follows was not simply a dream?  It didn't feel like a dream, I felt I was awake but out of normal condition.  Consider this, in a dream state I seem to accept everything that happens no matter how bizarre as 'real' but in this incident and all during it I was continually rejecting it, thinking that \"this was impossible, this can't be happening,\" and as each level unfolded I continued to be confounded at the content. In short,  I could evaluate which is a higher order of thinking that is beyond dream awareness. \n \nAnyway, the impossibility got worse as I am somehow transported (floated) up to a classic silver flying saucer! I clearly remember seeing the hull out of the dark, where the two ends converge and I am absolutely stunned, thinking, what the?  This can't be happening!  That is a flying saucer!  This thing was parked above our house in the dark but I could see it in the dark. \n \nAnd at the next instant I am inside! I see what appears to be a human military man American, I presume, I don't know the words he is saying but I sense his anger, this man is extremely angry about something.  I later believe that he was possibly mad that I am awake because I may have said something to him or he could see my eyes were open!  I am aware of other human beings United States Military men on board.  I don't seem to be walking or I can't feel my legs.  I am transported into the center of the craft and put on a table on my back and doctors surround me and immediately commence brain surgery!  My mind seems to be cracked open and I am seemingly transported to another area, larger space and I feel at this time very afraid as it has gone from impossible to unfathomable and I am simply overwhelmed and feel as if I am a whimpering thought of \"bodylessness\" (a ghost of some kind)!  This operation seems I can hear others conversing but the words are not understandable,! but I can sense their communication amongst themselves. This is the longest period of time and is fuzzy as to details. After some time I seem to lose all consciousness and after more time I wake up in my bed the next morning. The sun is shining and I begin another day at work! But I have immediate recall of the above and I am simply befuddled as to how to understand it. I was shocked by it all! It all had a very real unreal feeling about it but I could not be sure. For the next 30 years or so I would never discuss this with a single soul. I was too scared to admit it for anyone would think I was nuts! The book Communion had a line that solidified for me that it may indeed be real with the line \"...and they implanted something in my brain...\" after that I was a wreak for the next year or so trying to accept its reality. Finally after 5 or 10 years and then seeing the culture start to talk about this kind of thing (the Simpsons had scenes of people being abducted u! p into space ships and more people started coming out with sim! ilar sto ries) then I started to lighten up about it. Now I can freely discuss it without too much distress. \n \n Some interesting points: The album cover by Emerson Lake and Palmer really keyed me in at the time: \"Brain Salad Surgery\" that painting depicted very well what I felt was similar to the experience in some form. There was a robotic feeling about it. \n \n The man in the ship, I later saw a photo of General Curtis Lemay and I swear the fellow on board looked so much like that man that I think it was him!  At that time (1975) there had not been any reports of anything like this happening to people, being sucked up into a flying saucer! Surgery?! So I was not influenced by anything from the culture, this was totally new and totally unexpected. \n \n I was apparently unharmed. Just a bit freaked out as we say! No physical evidence was noted on myself, I didn't even look for any. \n \n That is about it, I wanted to report it officially somewhere so it can go into the record. I don't seem to have any recollection of anything like this happening to me before or since. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Ofcourse i wasn't, but the physical feeling of a struggle to raise up off the couch was definitely present. As i could only sit i couldnt stand still have no clue as to why. i noticed the woods behind my house was completely illuminated as if there were flood lights on or a landing light on a helicopter as if it was searching. I know for a fact it wasn't any rotory aircraft. I also recall as if i was very cold and started to develop goosebumps in a big way. Eventually i was able to force myself to stand up. Only took me about 5 or 6 minutes to push myself up and walk over to the double french doors which lead to our sun patio. as i stood by the window the light faded with a slight flicker then was gone. Now im not quite sure how much time has past since this first inccident to the 2nd but, it wasnt too long after. I had made myself go to sleep in my beedroom. \n \n I was awaken by the same erie noise as before except this time its directly out front and above my room windows. I have 3 windows in my room 2 large windows in the front and one smaller window on the side over top of my garage. Whatever this light was, shining thru my windows as if to see or whatever . I just knew somehow or for somereason this wasnt right. I knew enough to stay outa the lights. i do remember a chilly, cold like heat coming from outside, kinda like a vapor rub type wind. i know it sounds strange but thats the best way to explain it. almost menthol like. i wasnt able to yell but i was able to move and walk better this time . So being the wimp that i am i hid in my closet like a freak and never told anyone about it til now. \n \n I woke up in the morning in my closet to a beautiful day. Even though for days i havent been able to sleep alone. This really scared the crap outa me. \n \n Mr.D, When I made this post, I was unaware of the time allotment. This happened to me quite some time ago. It wasn't recent. It took a long time for me to even get the courage to really come forward to post this.

As we were passing the school heading down Crumpton South, I noticed what appeared to be a planet sized orange/red object in the sky.  It was at about 40 degrees above the horizon (facing south/southwest). At first I thought it was mars or mercury, but it seemed to big to be a planet (appeared a little bigger than I have seen Venus). I kept walking while watching the object.  It appeared to become slightly bigger, so I stopped before I reached a group of trees that would block my view so I could see if it was moving like an airplane with its lights on.  It wasn't, so I started walking again and thinking about what it could be.  When I got past the trees to where I could see it again, it had changed from an orange/red glow to a single white light(much smaller), like you would see on a plane.  It blinked once, maybe twice, then moved in a quickly accelerating motion at approx 20 degrees up and to my left, out into the atmosphere. At it's fastest rate, it looked just a little slower than a shooting star.  I was looking south/slightly southwest the entire time.  It was still very dark, enough so to still be able to see all the stars in the sky. I was going to call the local airports to see if they noticed anything unusual on their radars at that time, but didn't think I could get through to the controllers, or whether they would give me the information if I could get through.  If you can get that type of information, I would appreciate you letting me know what they picked up on their equipment.

At approximately 1:15 am we noticed a very low and slow flying object approaching from the south.  It sounded very strange emitting an low electric humming sound changing in pitch.  As is approached the sound increased in intensity but was then also accompanied by a jet engine sound. Not a jet engine in flight, but a jet engine idling. As the first approached we noticed a second craft in the distance coming from the same direction.  The first craft passed almost directly overhead and was probably less then 500 feet off the ground and flying slower then 100 mph, probably slower! Slower then any aircraft i've ever seen.  I've lived near an airport all my life so i know what planes and helicopters look like.  This didn't fit either description.  I saw 4 or 5 whitesh yellowish lights. Some of the lights appeared to be spinning to me,  but my friend could not recall them spinning.  The lights looked like standard aircraft lights, but the position of these lights on the craft looked strange. I could not make out the shape of the craft.  Though the most noticable thing about it was the strange noise it was making and it seemed to float across the sky rather then fly. After the first craft flew overhead, a second followed about 30 to 45 seconds behind. On this craft we could only see 1 light of the same white yellowish color.  It too was flying very slow and directly overhead in the same direction.  Though i don't think it was making the same strange hum the first object was.  It sounded like a jet but was flying way too slow.  And it did not sound like a helicopter. No strange electric or magnetic effects were objerved.  My guess is its probably ours, a craft which still uses conventional jet engines while also having some anti-gravitic technology integrated in. Could this account for the jet-engine sound and the strange loud humming noise?", "posted": "2001-04-28T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.0913", "city_longitude": "-76.9377", "latitude": 39.0913, "longitude": -76.9377 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.9377, 39.0913 ] } },

I saw an orange white light basically shoot down and across the sky and stop dead a hundred or so feet away about 30 to 50 feet above the ground. Well, I have to tell you it was pretty damn startling to say the least. It just kinda hoverd there then would wobble a little and move sideways then hover again. The first thing I thought was did anyone else see this but near as I could tell my nieghbors were all indoors and I was the only one there since I live alone. I really didnt want to move but i thought I gotta get a picture of this. I ran inside and started to grab my polaroid but it was out of film so I had to settle for my digital instead. Its flash is broke but its all I had so I tried anyways. When I got back outside it had apparently move some more and was a bit lower to the ground but not much. I was kinda scared to get any closer so I just snapped a couple pictures right where I was. One of them came out ok I guess so thats the one Im sending. It looked as though it was domed or kinda like a half a donut with some  smaller dome with a point on top of it. It had what looked like smaller lights all the way around it. There wasnt any noise really but it seemed like I heard a very low hum but Im not sure if that was this thing or something from the traffic down the road or not. The lights on it would kinda alternate between yellowish and orange to white now and then. It seemed like it would always wobble before it moved also. It would wobble then shift to the side. When the lights on it were mostly white it looked like it was shiny on the outside like silver or a shiny grey color. I tried to watch it every second it was sitting there doing this stuff. I just couldnt figure out what in the world this thing was. I was going to try getting more pictures of it and started to reset the camera but Im telling you this thing all of a sudden shot straight up! I mean like a rocket except it was like one second it was sitting still and the next it was moving at top! speed o r something. Either the lights on it went out or it just dissapeard becuase I lost sight of it almost immediatly after it went up. Im not really sure what else to put here so I guess this it. Its taken me awhile to convince myself to send this to someone but since I would really like to know just what this was I guess I have no choice. I showed a few friends this pic but I havent really told them the whole story. They thought the pic was \"neat\" but were more interested in making jokes when I asked them what they thought it looked like to them. Maybe someone else saw the same thing? At least thats what I am hoping. Right now I am not even sure I want to get more involved in this than I am so if I could stay anaonymous for the time being that would be great. I will leave my email address so you can contact me if you need to. Ill try to help out if I can so let me know what else there is if you need it .", "posted": "2000-12-02T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.1269", "city_longitude": "-76.698", "latitude": 39.1269, "longitude": -76.698 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.698, 39.1269 ] } },

Something caught my eye and I looked toward the river, which is west, and then I saw the shapes racing through the clouds on the horizon. Initially, I just stood there, shocked.  I went to my co-workers residence and made him come out. The spheres were moving very quickly, back and forth on the horizon. The higher sphere didn't move as much or as quickly as the lower sphere.  They must've been quite large, but we never saw anything but the reflected light in the clouds.  The lower sphere was looping up and around under the higher sphere. The higher sphere stopped occasionally, but the lower one never stopped. \n \nI heard the truck then, at the end of the driveway, and we went to get the horses.  I drove to the road because I was afraid, and when the driver got out, he was shaken and said the spheres had been almost on top of his truck for the last 2 miles.  The driver said at one point, he had to lean forward and look up out of his windshield (he drove a tractor trailer) to see them.

My wife spotted an object she thought was a planet very close to the moon. I walked outside and she asked me to look at the planet next to the moon. It was early twilight. I looked and saw what appeared to be a star or planet just at the edge of the moon. It was apparently just at the edge of the moon on the dark side of a 3/4 full moon. I watched it for maybe 30 seconds and during this time it did not move at all in relation to the moon. I was going through my mind to try and figure what planet it might be, but none came to mind that would be in that part of the sky. All of a sudden the object started moving in a direction which from my perspective was toward 2 O'clock in relation to the moon. It moved much to slowly to be a satellite. It was not possible to tell if it moved in front of or behind the moon as it passed the top 1/5 of the moon. In 5 minutes it moved a little more than the width of a hand at arms length. The whole time the brightness of the object was about what the star Sirius would appear like at that time of day and it did not waver. My wife went in and got a pair of 12x50 binoculars about 2 minutes into this sighting, in the binoculars the object was no more visible than it was without them. Then as we were talking about it the object at some point disappeared, but no one actually saw it when it did finally disappeared. I did manage one digital photograph of the object with my Olympus 5 megapixel C-5050, I am sending it to you although it does not look like much. The photo shows both the object and the moon. \n \n We can only figure it was one of two things. A balloon which very coincidentally did an apparent hover right at the point that it was resting on the very edge of the moon on the dark side and then proceeded to apparently move on and finally dissapear. The other is that it was a huge spacecraft near the moon which decided to leave while we were looking. It was certainly not a star, planet, or satellite, and it was not an airplane or jet or space shuttle. If this was a spacecraft near the moon you most certainly will have other reports of it, as it was difficult to miss. \n \n", "posted": "2003-07-16T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.13854140127388", "city_longitude": "-77.21494904458599", "latitude": 39.138541401273883, "longitude": -77.214949044585993 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.214949044585993, 39.138541401273883 ] } },

I know that this form is for UFO sightings only, however, what I heard last night was so strange that it had to be something unexplainable.   \n \nI was sitting up in bed reading, and I heard something just outside my window (there’s a busy street just by my house) that at first sounded like screeching tires.  I thought that someone had hit a deer because there are many that live by in the area, but then the tone of the screeching changed.  There were three different tones to it, and the duration of each tone would last for about ten seconds and then it would change.  I realized as soon as it changed that it wasn’t a car crash. The sound continued to change in tones without any brea! ks in between.  As crazy as this sounds, it sounded like that scene in Close Encounters of the Third Kind where they contact the aliens using music. It was very loud and very high pitched.  It went on for at least 2 minutes.  I looked out my window to see if I could see anything in the sky, but my window isn’t at a very good vantage point, and I didn’t want to go outside because I was worried I’d miss the noise.  I didn’t feel at all scared or threatened.  It was just very strange, and I knew that I was experiencing something that wasn’t normal. I think that someone else out on the road either heard what I was hearing, or saw something because in the midst of the noise going on,  I did hear a separate noise of tires coming to a hault out on the road.  So this is just pure speculation, but perhaps someone saw something in the sky. \n \n Last year when I saw the Triangular shaped craft, it was very large, and had a lot of different colors of lights all around it. It approached my neighborhood, which is a townhouse community, and stopped over a row of houses. It hovered there for a few seconds, and then took off at a sharp 90 degree angle, and was completely gone. During that sighting there was no sound whatsoever that came from the craft, even when it took off. A few nights later my mother was out walking our dog, and she saw what perhaps could be the same craft. It approached the same row of houses, making no noise at all, and then took off and reappeared in the same area, took off again , then reappeared in a different section of the sky almost as if it was shuffling across the sky. \n \n I’m wondering if perhaps there was another craft in the area and if perhaps more people are going to report experiences like this where they see a craft and hear music coming from the craft. Perhaps they’re attempting to communicate with us now.", "posted": "2012-08-05T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.13854140127388", "city_longitude": "-77.21494904458599", "latitude": 39.138541401273883, "longitude": -77.214949044585993 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.214949044585993, 39.138541401273883 ] } },

I was driving south on Rt. 70S (now Rt. 270) and had just gone under the Shady Grove Road overpass.  The day was gloomy, almost like a foggy-rainy day but it was not raining; the clouds just seemed to be very low.  As I came out from the underpass, I saw this \"big thing\" above me.  It had no wings that I could determine and I tried hard to speed up to keep getting a better look.  I probably got up to about 80, but it was no contest.  It was black (I could only see the underside at first), and at arm's length I would say it was about 6-8 inches in diameter, a real big-un as they say. As it continued south in front of me and drew away, I could see that it had green sequentially flashing lights along the rear (but I could not, of course, see whether these lights went all around the object).  It then slowly changed course toward the East and I lost sight of it because I had to drive.  I think the object was going about 300-400 mph -- it reminded me of the way a C130 had looked the day a friend said, \"It isn't going that slow, it is just that big.\"  I let it go out of my mind, but the next morning I heard on the radio that the Air Force had reported that the object seen by a number of people was an experimental plane they were testing.  It did seem to me that something that size would have had a budget that people would be arguing about.  If it was a secret, why were they testing it in broad daylight?

We cannot be certain that this is intended as a serious report.  PD)) \n \nI saw several flying lights heading from north to south \n \nIt was around 22:00 hrs on May 1, 2007, I saw through the window of a bedroom on the second floor of my house an intense light in the air at a half-mile distance. The light was so intense by far several times the light of any star. The object was also a short distance from the surface of the ground. The light went up straight vertically, diminished its intensity and moved to the left from north to south and disappeared. \n \n Since the local fire station is located in that direction and about the same distance I thought that the object might be a helicopter, however I was curious and decided to investigate some more. Immediately I grabbed my car and went to the fire station to see what was going on. My sister was with me in my car. When we reached the fire station, one of the garage doors was open and the truck was in there and nobody around. We passed the fire station when I saw the light again, this time farther out to the right of the road heading from north to south.  I decided to drive in its direction to get closer and make sure it was a helicopter. The light disappeared when I entered one of the streets on the right. We went out of those streets and went back to the road heading east for about two minutes when we saw the light again this time it was to our left like a half mile away and in the air. I don’t think it was the same object since the previous one we saw disappeared to the right of the road and this last one appeared on the left of the road heading from north to south. The flying object crossed in front of us from the left to the right of the road and dissappeared going from north to south. We tried to follow it, making a right in an intersection where was about to the point the object disappeared but we couldn’t see it. Then, we started to head back home going from south to north for about two more minutes when I saw again another light in the air. It looked like an helicopter in the distance because of its movement. It was flying slowly from north to south relatively close to the ground, so I was sure it couldn’t be a plane. Its light was not intense. I reached an intersection and stopped because of a red light of a traffic light, while the object was heading to from North to South while I was facing South to North. The object was coming to my direction in the air. At that moment I remembered I had binoculars in the glove compartment of my car and I grabbed them and give them to my sister, it turns out that! she did n’t know how to use them. Since the car was stopped she pulled down the window and took her head out and looked up and saw the lights of the object and introduced her head back into the car. I immediately took the binoculars out of her and pulled down the window of my side and took my head out of the car completely and used the binoculars to see the object. At that moment the object was right on my head a short distance from the ground, probably a four or five-block distance from the ground. I looked at the object using the binoculars and saw the chasis of a spaceship, the shape was triangular and flat. It had lights on the base, but those lights were not intense at all, but they shined enough to light the base of the chasis and I could saw the frame of the spaceship clearly,  not only the frame but all the flat metal part of the space ship which was lighted by the round light sources on the chasis. Those lights were no intense at all. They were just lighted spots one next to the other one covering almost the total area of the triangular chasis. I had never seen anything like that before in my whole life.  Since I was stopped by the red light I did all these things very quickly and only could see the bottom part or chasis of the flying object for a quick second. But because it was flying slowly close to the ground and I was using binoculars I could see it clearly. Also I realized that it did not make any sound. It was just flying slowly and quietly. \n \nWhen the traffic light changed to green I decided to follow the flying object to see it again, but U-turns were forbidden at that intersection and I had to turn to the left. While driving in the new road I stopped in the middle part of the road between the lanes and made a U turn and in the same interception where I saw the object I made a right turn to head in the same direction the flying object was flying but I could not see it anymore. Then we returned home. I particularly do not think these lights belonged to the same flying object, since all of them were moving from north to  south, I actually see in total four flying lights heading each time from north to south, but only in the last one I could see it using my binoculars and determine that it was not a helicopter or any plane.", "posted": "2007-06-12T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.13854140127388", "city_longitude": "-77.21494904458599", "latitude": 39.138541401273883, "longitude": -77.214949044585993 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.214949044585993, 39.138541401273883 ] } },

Although I didn’t note the time in my car, I called my wife on her cell phone when I was stopped at Bourdeaux Pl about a couple of minutes after the initial sighting. Her call log indicates 7:45pm for this call. The sighting was on the route of my daily commute since August 2002. \n \nDuration: At least a few minutes. \n \nI was driving at the time. There was one car very close behind – probably because I had slowed down considerably. I was frustrated by the proximity of this car which forced me to continue out of the line of sight of the object (now behind me), down a hill and up the other side of the valley. It was probably close to a mile later when I was able to safely pull over into a right turn lane for Bourdeaux Place (probably about 2 minutes later) – see map (UFO_sighting_location_Feb_15_2012_1.PNG). At this location I could look across. I could still see the object. \n \nDescription: Appearance: Apparently triangular with closely-spaced twin red and green lights (one set at each apex). The lights spanned Goshen Rd. The central light appeared somewhat higher than the ones to the right (East) and the left (West). The lights were not strobed and appeared similar in separation from my viewpoint. When I first saw the object I was at the STOP at Warfield Rd, traveling North on Goshen Road. The object was to the North of me. For a brief moment I thought it was a commercial airliner at a frighteningly low altitude, but immediately afterward it appeared like the triangular object was floating and seemed to be canting slowly. I could not make out for sure if there was matter between the three twinned light sources because it was very dark. I got a good idea of the distance between the three light sources because within a few hundred feet, just after passing Lochaven drive, I had passed underneath the object and all three points were behind me. The central apex lig! hts passed right overhead. The lights on the other apeces were perhaps over the houses on each side of the road. \n \nReconstruction (from memory): Unfortunately I do not have a photo or video. However, I have used an image of the approximate initial viewpoint of the object in front of me from Google Maps. The daytime view of the location would be approximately like this:  SEE E-MAILED IMAGE scene_Goshen_and_Lochaven-day.PNG  I have tried to sketch what I saw (and the scale) by using the above daytime Google Maps image and inking out the sky. It was a very clear (cloudless) night, but dark – no moonlight I think. The object then looked something like that shown below: (I cannot be sure if the green was on the left or the right of the red and the lights may have been slightly closer together and more aligned in a fixed direction than I have indicated. Also this reconstruction shows definite sky between the points, whereas in reality I could not make out any sky between the points - only blackness – but the illustration gives an idea of what I saw). \n \nSEE E-MAILED IMAGE: approx_reconstruction_UFO.PNG  Scale: From the fact that I had passed underneath all three points of light within a few hundred feet at low speed, I could tell that these lights were at low altitude, perhaps 100 to 150 ft up and that the object spanned perhaps 150 to 200 feet on one edge. \n \nSound: I did not have any windows open but detected no sound at all. \n \nAction taken immediately afterwards: The first place I was able to safely pull over with a line of sight to the original location of the sighting was in a right turn-only lane dedicated to a residential street (Bourdeaux Place, just West of Route 124). At this location, I got out and walked a little East to gain a sight around some trees. I could see the tree line on the other side of the valley and the three points of light just above the tree line, but now planar (horizontal). It seemed like the object had moved somewhat East and was no longer tilted up. Looking at the Google map later, and the orientation of Bourdeaux Drive relative to the initial location, I would say that this assumption was accurate. I got on my cell phone and called my wife to tell her that something weird was going on and asked her to put on the local news to see if anything had been reported. I then got back into my car and continued home. At little later (on Howard Chapel Rd - the Montgomery County part) I again pulled over to look ba! ck across towards Gaitherburg but didn’t see anything unusual. \n \nAction taken on Thursday February 16, 2012 I decided that I would take no further action until I returned on my morning commute the next day in daylight. This would take me on the exact reverse route through the location of the sighting. There was nothing visible that could possibly explain what I saw the previous night and everything appeared normal. Once at the office I decided to call the Airport Manager at: Montgomery County Airpark 7940 Airpark Drive, Gaithersburg, MD 20879 Phone: (301) 963-7100 An answering machine kicked in so I had to leave a message for the manager. I tried to describe what I saw in a way that wouldn’t be instantly dismissed as a “crackpot call”. I left my name and my NIST office number and requested that they call be if they could explain what I might have seen. As of today I have not been contacted. I also told a colleague, who happens to live on Lochaven Drive, about my experience.  She and her family were at home but had not seen or heard anything.  She said she would ask neighbors who walk their dogs at about that time. I am guessing that perhaps dozens of others may have seen what I saw on that stretch of road at that time, so I have checked the internet periodically to see if there are any similar reports.  So far I have not seen any but I want to log my experience.  Who knows? Maybe someone else saw this and either dismissed it or failed to report it.", "posted": "2012-05-13T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.13854140127388", "city_longitude": "-77.21494904458599", "latitude": 39.138541401273883, "longitude": -77.214949044585993 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.214949044585993, 39.138541401273883 ] } },

The ramp dumps you onto the road about 50 feet before you go under the Shady Grove Road underpass.   \n \nJust as I was heading under I noticed something round up in the sky.  As I emerged from the underpass I was already looking up to see if I could see the object.  At first I couldn't and I wondered if it had changed direction, when all of a sudden it came into view, not high, but at a much lower altitude than at first.  It was crossing the highway in front of my car going roughly from NW to SE.  I think it was flying too low for legal airspace.  \n \nAt that point, since I was almost under it, it looked just like a big black disk, but a second or two later it got far enough away to see the edge of it -- which was a band of sequentially-flashing green lights.  That's when I knew this wasn't anything ordinary.   \n \nIt continued in the SE direction -- I sped up to about 90 MPH because it was the only thing I could do to see more, but I couldn't keep up ...

It began to veer slightly toward the east. ....  \n \nThe next morning, in almost the exact spot, WPGC announced that the Air Force said that the object reported by some observers the day before was 'an experimental airplane with sequentially flashing lights.'  The announcement did not include anything about the fact that this object had no wings of the type our aircraft usually has. ...  \n \nThe sighting occurred about 9 a.m. over a highway that in those days wasn't as busy as it is in 2005, but there was other traffic besides myself.   \n \nI'll never forget this and am still hoping to find someone else who saw it and did the research to find out what it is.   \n \nSince the radio announcement said the Air Force made the statement, and the object did kind of veer off toward Andrews AFB, I never talked about it for 28 years.

I do not have contact information for the witness presently, but I can get it. \n \nIn 1977 the witness (age 17 at the time)and his cousin were returning home to obey their 12 a.m. curfew.  As they were heading up a road towards the Heights in Montgomery Village, MD, near Gaithersburg, the witness saw a light through some trees at the top of the hill and asked his cousin \"What's that?\". His cousin replied \"They're digging a lake up there; it must be some construction lights.\"  They continued up the hill, came around a bend in the road, and saw a cigar-shaped object hovering over a telephone pole approximately 40 feet in the air and 50 feet in front of them. \n \n The witness and his cousin stopped the car and got out to look at the object, which he described as shaped like a \"one-manned submarine\", being about the size of a school bus, and as having a metallic skin, 2 beams projecting from the \"front,\" and a row of \"portholes\" and non-blinking red and green lights around the circumference.  The object was completely silent and stationary for approximately 20 seconds, then made a soft, mechanical \"verrrt\" sound and began to move slowly away. \n \n The witness emphasized 2 things: how \"man-made\" and \"nuts and bolts\" the object seemed (\"like an airliner with no tail, wings, or jet engines\") and the strange way that it appeared to move away slowly, yet diminished rapidly in size until it disappeared.  He had a difficult time describing exactly how the object departed. \n \n He said that the surface of the craft was visible from the glare of the projecting beams (\"kind'a like laser beams, not spreading out like headlights\"), and that it was metallic.  There were also dark patches above the view ports where he thought there was some movement visible (as in something moving inside the object). \n \n The witnesses' car exhibited no electromagnetic effects from the close proximity of the craft; the engine continued to idle and the headlights remained on, and neither witness suffered any physiological effects.

I work in an industrial park and the area I was in was cleared of trees and obstructions.  I looked toward the south and there was a circular object moving VERY slowly right above the treeline.  The oval object had orange circular lights going around the whole of the ship and I stood there crossing out everything that it could be in my mind. It was most definetly NOT a balloon or a cloud or a plane or a helicopter. It was moving so slow that a plane has to be crossed out and if it was some stealth kind of military plane the shape was all wrong. It was NOT sleek or strong looking. Actually it looked sort of huge and clunky. It looked like something out of like a 50’s sci fi movie and not some newfound classic CGI spaceship that adorn our movie screens today. I knew that the ship was soon going to descend out of my sight beyond the treeline so I yelled at one of my coworkers who was approximat! ely 50 feet away. As I ran over to her the object just reached a point where it could not be seen anymore. I asked her, “Did you see that UFO?” and she said, “Is that what it was? I saw it and I don’t know WHAT that was…” The object if I had to estimate was very large I would say half a football field in length (150 feet) and I was appox. 150 feet away when I saw it. I witnessed the craft for about 15 seconds. It was dusk and I think that actually helped in assuring me it was a UFO and not something else. If it had been completely dark I would have probably chalked it up to something natural because then I could have ONLY seen the lights. Although it was too dark to accurately identify the color of the ship I could at least see the outline and it was in my opinion not of this world.

I watched it sporadically for about a minute when I realized that it was moving slowly west to east and did not display any of the normal commercial aircraft warning lights.  As we live very close to Baltimore-Washington International Airport we are very familiar with the characteristics of normal commercial aircraft, both during the day and at night.  At that time the light was about two times as bright as Sirus is at it's brightest.  I grabbed a pair of 10X binoculars and watched it for about two minutes.  It passed almost directly over my house.  During that time the brightness intensified to about three or four times that of Sirus.  I could see none of the normal aircraft warning lights; there were no wing-tip red/green lights and no strobe lights.  The light displayed by the craft was entirely too bright to be the normal aircraft landing lights we are used to seeing at night.  I ran inside, called my wife to follow me, and went out the front door.  We both watched it for another minute or two before it went out of sight behind some trees.  It passed less than a mile south of BWI Airport at about 19:11. \n \nThe brightness of the light intensified as it approached my house and lessened as it moved away.  However, the light was a constant white color, very comparable to the color of Sirus, but without the splashes of color that I often see in Sirus.  The intensity of the light was the only variable I noticed. \n \nAs close as I can estimate, the light approached from a bearing of about 250 degrees (true) and departed on a bearing of about 70 degrees (true).  I would further estimate that the light would have passed almost directly over the intersection of routes 100 and 170 at about 19:10.  I could not discern any craft or shape against the sky.  The weather was clear and visiblity was excellent.  The stars were easily seen; there was no moon. \n \n Although I do not kow what it might have been, it was not a star or a commercial aircraft, and it was much, much brighter than any satellite I've seen before. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

There was no sign of any smoke or other exhaust features. \n \nThey were moving relatively slowly, and stayed in view for about 40 seconds before I drove past the point where they were off my right side and out of my sight.  If they stayed on that course, they would have passed over the Germantown area. \n \nI was in heavy morning rush hour traffic, in the center lane, and could not pull over to either side to stop for a better view. \n \nI don't know for sure what they were, and, unless we have technology that I am not aware of, I seriously doubt that they were made by man - homo sapiens. \n \nAll of my life, I have believed that we are not alone.  Now, unless this can be explained away, I am very sure we are NOT alone! \n \n \n((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) \n \nHi Mr. Davenport, \nI did report it to another site, but they never published anything on it.  I just found out about your site due to an article in the newspaper (Frederick, MD News Post).  Thank you for taking interest in it. \n \nAnd, yes, it WAS a dramatic sighting!  I was in heavy rush hour traffic in the middle lane of 3.  They were flying just above treetop level.  The driver in the car to my left obviously saw it also, but the look on his face was absolute terror.  I seriously doubt he told anyone about it.  I did confide in a few friends - almost sorry I did.  I don't think any of them believe me.  I only wish I could have gotten to my phone to use the camera in it.  I have ordered a dash cam, just to make sure something like this never happens - undocumented \n- again.     \n \nI couldn't stop to get a better view either, due to the traffic.  I even had a policeman in our church check to see if there were any other sightings.  The only thing he could tell me was, \"Yes, there were.\" \n \nI was not frightened by it.  But, I must admit, I have lost a few nights sleep wondering who/what they were, where were they from, what were they doing here - so many questions I would like to ask them if I had the opportunity.  I wouldn't mind taking a ride in a ufo either, assuming I could come back from it! \n \nThe cylinders were so large, I have wondered if it could have been the beginning of an invasion.  My guess is each of the 2 cylinders could easily have accommodated \n2-300 or more human sized troops.  I would also guess the 3rd craft was a control unit. \n \nAs I drove down the road after the sighting, a big black helicopter flew past me headed in the direction I had seen the objects going. Interesting!! \n \nI must admit I am a sci-fi devotee, and I write some under the name ((name and e-address deleted)).  This sighting WILL be going into a story I have started. \n \nI have now posted a page on my website, www.((address deleted))l detailing the encounter.  Feel free to link to it if you want to. \n \nIf only I could contact them - assuming they are friendly.  Oh, SO MANY QUESTIONS! \n \n((name deleted)) \n \n((END ADDENDUM))", "posted": "2015-07-17T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.1465562992126", "city_longitude": "-77.27231023622046", "latitude": 39.146556299212598, "longitude": -77.272310236220463 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.272310236220463, 39.146556299212598 ] } },

Before deciding that what I was witnessing was in fact a UFO, I decided to use the app, “Google Sky” to make sure it was not just a bright star playing tricks on my eyes.  Oddly, my phone had absolutely no service, and though I can’t be sure that this and the object are related, after restarting my phone, it appeared to act normally again.   \n \nI then officially established that it was no star or planet. \n \nSometime around 4:20 AM, I finally decided to vocalize an observation that I thought was crazy: the object appeared to have tentacle-like attachments that both my friend and I had assumed earlier, were just reflections of the lighting.  These “tentacles” often came in and out of view and at times, made it look somewhat like a jellyfish in the sky. \n \nAround 4:45, I finally decided to awaken my mother as well as my boyfriend who live about a mile down the road to get their opinion on the animal-like object.  After seeing the UFO for himself, my boyfriend then woke up his uncle and we all watched together. \n \nAround 5:00 AM, three of us watched as some type of dark flying object flew towards the UFO and, as far as we believe, connected or went inside the larger, lightened UFO.  Around the same time, we also noticed yet another flying object within a decent distance that was much smaller and  flashed lights regularly.  This object, unlike the original large one, flew the sky at what looked to me like the pace of an airplane. \n \nAround 5:40, it was clear daylight and only the original bright and animal-like object was visible. It was very obviously, as well as slowly,  heading higher and higher in the sky.

I was standing on our lawn in the front of our house.  My body was facing East towards another row of townhomes in my development (the different rows of townhomes form a square.)  I had my head down because I was watching my dog but something caught my attention. I glanced up and I noticed lights directly above three of the townhomes in front of me (the homes are approximately 50 ft. away.)   I noticed there was a structure or formation to the lights.  The formation looked like the right wing of an airplane except the \"wing\" was very large.  I initially decided it was just a low flying airplane and I convinced myself that I couldn't see the rest of the plane because it was being obscured by trees. The lights appeared to be along the perimeter of the triangle or the \"wing\".  From what I remember all of the lights were white.  I can't remember if any of them were flashing. As I watched this structure I realized there was no sound associated with it and that it was just hovering.  At some point it just seemed to disappear and I couldn't figure out where it went. I didn't know if the trees had just obscured my view and it was just a plane that had flown away or if the \"plane\" had really just disappeared.  I remember being perplexed and a little excited/weirded out. My gut told me I had just seen a UFO.  I ran inside and told my husband about what I had seen (my husband was not impressed.) I also drew a picture of the \"plane\" in case I had seen a UFO.  I then called the police (at the risk of sounding crazy) and asked them if there had been any reports of unusual aircraft sightings or UFO's in the area and I was told \"no.\"  I felt like an idiot after calling the police and decided I had probably just seen a plane.  However, after reading accounts from others on this site, I am now doubting whether or not this really was just a \"plane\".  I really feel that what I saw was a UFO.  Am I going crazy?

I was looking out the window from the back seat when I saw a deep green light in the distance over the woods, in the sky, that moved slowly, horizontally, before pausing and dropping directly behind the trees. \n \n In 2014, my friend and I were walking our coworker to her car outside of our restaurant job in Germantown (at that time). As we were talking to her before she ducked into her car, I noticed, again, a deep green light in the distance, in the direction of Father Hurley Blvd. It moved horizontally before pausing and dropping vertically. Later that Summer, we were driving on the back roads at night (in Boyds), when we saw large lights scattered within close proximity of each other in the sky. What freaked us out were the helicopters (3) and the plane-like drone that were flying towards them. \n \n In 2016, I was walking home from a friends house mid-afternoon. I happened to glance up when I saw what looked like a large bundle of black balloons. What stood out to me was that they didn't appear to be moving, and I also couldn't make out if that's what it actually was (I can't see too well from afar). Shortly after, it broke up into several black pieces and sort of floated in the general direction I was walking in. I had taken my phone out and snapped a few photos right before it began to move, in which it had startled me. In me rushing home, my eyes kept on it when it eventually moved back together and kind of steadily and smoothly glided away. \n \n To add to 2016; there was a night when these two figures in my neighborhood displayed very bizarre behavior that still has yet to sit well with me. I was on my porch some time after midnight when I heard shoes dragging against gravel from the end of my neighborhood. These two figures turned the corner at the end of the neighborhood and began to slowly walk in my general direction. They stopped at one point before one of them started to walk backwards at an angle, never turning to see what was behind him/her. The other person was walking towards a white van when they appeared to see me before taking a single step behind the van. I went inside at that point because of the sketchy behavior. We had a large, bay window in the living room/front of the house, so I peered behind the curtain. After a moment, I watched one of them make their way down my sidewalk, up my yard, to the window. They just stood there, never moved to look in or around, they just stood in front of me. I didn'! t make out a face as everything was dark within their hood. I eventually ran to get my brother and called the police. The next day, my uncle who lived up the block from us, his truck had been broken into and all of the papers within it tossed. Nothing was taken. That probably has nothing to do with the sightings, however directly after this happened, I started having dreams about things being on fire and tanks/planes falling from the sky. The dreams have not stopped yet, and are almost always consistent on a daily basis. I read that someone else who claimed to have seen UFO's had two men in hooded attire knock on his door late at night who frightened him. He claimed to have seen weird things in his head and had consistent dreams of wars. That's what made me want to bring this to light. \n \n The last time I saw a UFO was in September of 2017 in Cancun, Mexico. It was at a resort and it seemed to be very far. It was pale looking and I think tic-tac like. I watched it move quickly back and forth but didn't know if I was actually seeing it. My brother's husband along with his brother claimed to then see it, which made me believe it was real. They are two of the biggest skeptics I know, so it solidified that for me. \n \n I hope this sheds some light on your research, and I appreciate the work you all do in learning and expanding on the general knowledge of life as a whole. \n \n", "posted": "2021-05-20T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.1465562992126", "city_longitude": "-77.27231023622046", "latitude": 39.146556299212598, "longitude": -77.272310236220463 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.272310236220463, 39.146556299212598 ] } },

Of course i wasn't, but the physical feeling of a struggle to raise up off the couch was definitely present.

I know for a fact it wasn't any rotory aircraft.  I also recall as if i was very cold  and started to develop goosebumps in a big way.  Eventually i was able to force myself to stand up.  Only took me about 5 or 6 minutes to push myself up  and walk over to the double french doors which lead to our sun patio.  as i stood by the window the light  faded with a slight flicker then was gone.

Take exit onto Md.  Rt. 100  proceed aprox. 1 mile.  4:24 am see what appears to be Jet landing at B.W.I.  Airport, which is about 3 miles up ahead.  Realize it is a large plane coming towards me, straight down the center of Rt. 100 Medium size plane much bigger than Piper cub , figured it was a Cargo plane.  Flying much lower than any plane I have ever seen that wasn’t coming in for a landing.  Since its flying directly at me, I figured I would get a good look to see what kinda plane this is.  It's very dark with thick cloud cover, no stars or moonlight. As it approached rather quickly, what I saw was a huge Rectangle with Qty :  4 large red and green lights.  Much bigger than traffic lights, I assume as big or bigger than sewer caps. Vividly clear green on front right and back left, and red on front left and back right. \n \nI was simply Marveling at this technology as these lights had lumins/intensity of traffic signals but emitted no glare, aura, did not radiate downward or illuminate the craft at all. Were not convex or concave but completely flat..  diffused light that had no bright spots, light was evenly emitted so as just one perfectly round flat,  I thought landing lights. Strange that the road as far as I could see in front and behind me was completely empty with the exception of one car behind me about 2 car lengths.  As it got close I was leaning forward on the steering wheel looking almost straight up at the underneath of the vehicle.  Could only see a giant rectangle.  Could see no outline of an object, plane, helicopter. Seemed to be only couple hundred feet above me.  The one thought I was having is that this couldn’t be a plane, the rectangle way too wide for a fuselage of a plane.  At that point it turned clockwise 280 degrees and made a right turn as I am looking at it in 0.5 seconds.  If one was to count out loud “one thousand one”, being one second.  The object spun on an axis completely around by the time you get; one thous out of your mouth.  “And one” the second half of the word, the object had moved right turn 90 degrees and never changed or altered acceleration. 92 degrees actually.   \n \nBy this time the object would be passing over top of my truck and I had to look thru the moon roof.  Where I could see it was actually traveling at a slight different angle now that I had a 3rd reference point, my truck roof.  Making a maneuver of 270 degrees plus, there was forward momentum to take into account.  When looking skyward seeing only dark and a rectangle I saw a perfect right turn , but looking thru the moonroof it had turned right but was still sliding a bit forward at the same time, thus explaining the slightly more than a 90 degree turn it made would compensate for the forward momentum after a few seconds, and put it exactly on course. What was the rear of the vehicle, is now the front of the vehicle headed to my! right at 90 degrees.  So it's like polarity in the propulsion system had been switched simultaneously. Of course at this point my mind going into Shock was thinking only one thing. \n \nWhat did I just see?  This is certainly not possible,, could this have been a helicopter.  A helicopter could have easily fit inside this rectangle and couldn’t do a maneuver that quick that precise even if it were hovering. \n \nIt made no sound at all, seemed to be about 300 ft high and must have been cloaked to imitate the sky color as I never was able to make out any object or shape other than a crystal clear rectangle of spectacular lights.  Always dreamed of being lucky enough to see a flying saucer or something.  Never in my wildest dreams thought I would see something like this practically in my face.  The figure was exact shape of a football field. I could fit my house and garage inside its length.  I figure the object was 80 to 150 ft long and 40 or 60 ft wide. \n \nThis is a shortened version of what I saw and the calculations.  Would love to talk to someone futher about this incident. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

And we were just exiting the little store, when this giant glowing gold orb about as big as a Walmart crunched into a ball slid quickly through the sky, silent as anything, like it killed sound for a minute to get away in stealth, but the silence was so thudding, like bass on a radio, you could feel it in your stomach almost. It had little white port-holes (We couldn't tell what shape, they were so brightly shining.) and they were all across the ship in one big, thick, sideways \"Y\" shape. \n \nAnyway, the ship wasn't spinning or rotating, just speeding away. But it was strange, this thing was so bright but didn't light up the sky one bit. \n \nSo then came the second UFO orb, red, and glaring. But this one wasn't quiet at all. It had the sound of a large, metal bowl, with broken lightbulbs scraping around inside. It was a noise that scratched the inside of our skulls like really gritty sandpaper. And this one was red like lava, with ripples, or two golden bands, one inside the other, all over it. This ship was the same size as the other one, or maybe bigger, and was speeding after it, like it was chasing it. \n \nAfter that ship passed, we waited for the others to come.

When I returned to my bedroom, there was a bright light solid blue light shining onto the carpet on the floor in my bedroom.  It was in the shape of a semi-circle.  It almost looked like a half of a spotlight shining on the floor. I am not good with measurements but I think the diameter was probably 8 inches long (maybe the size of the top half of a small personal pizza.) The light was still and did not move.  I did not hear any noise outside.  At first I thought maybe it was a car headlight.  Then I realized that this explanation was not possible since our bedroom backs up to a heavily wooded area and there are no cars around.  Our bedrooms are also on the second floor (we live in a townhome) and the blinds  were halfway down so there was no way a light could project into our room and shine onto the floor in the shape of a semi-circle. I began looking around to see if I could find the source of the light.  I could not see any blue light coming in through the window, but I decided to look out of the window anyway.  As I took a step forward, the light on the floor disappeared.   When I looked outside I did not see anything or hear anything.  I looked for planes and or helicopters that might have had search lights but I saw nothing in the sky.  The whole episode lasted approximately 30 seconds or less.  Today I called the non-emergency police number to see if there had been any other sightings of this light or if there had been any search helicopters in the area. I was told there were no other reportings of any lights but it was a possibility a helicopter was in the area.  However, the dispatcher was unable to confirm whether there was a helicopter in the area at that time.

At 20:55 on Monday I went out to walk my dog and I was out there for about 8 minutes before I looked up into the night sky and noticed 4 objects traveling in a straight lined formation with a 5th object trailing behind slightly. The four aircraft were evenly spaced apart and it seemed as the 5th object was catching up somewhat. I then looked behind the lined formation of 5 aicraft and noticed that there was not another one behind. This is when I ran to the window where my brother was sitting in the house and I started knocking on it getting him to come outside real quick because I thought the formation was very unnatural. It took my brother about 20 seconds to put shoes on and when I brought him outside more objects appeared, this time about 7-10 aircraft with even spacing in between them and travelling in the same strai! ght line and direction as the previous craft. They were moving in a straight line although some of the aircraft seemed to wobble slightly, it was very small almost unnoticeable unless you focused on them.

Saw it for about 1 second before it \"cloaked\". \n \nI was walking my dog on the evening of March 13, 2012 at 8:30pm. I walk her around the school, which is located behind my house.  There is a large field with baseball diamonds etc. I was checking out the Venus/Jupiter view constantly as I walked because I thought it was really cool to see them so bright and close.  There were also absolutely no clouds in the sky.  Towards the end of our walk, I was in an area where there was no light so it was pretty dark area.  I looked up to check out the planets again and immediately saw what my brain told me was an airplane.  Then after about 1 second it disappeared.  The way it disappeared was a little alarming because it didn’t “zoom off” as the way most people describe. The best way I could describe is that it looked like it had “cloaked” it self.  It was there and the seemed to quickly dissolve from the front to the back.  The object was moving forward, the same speed a plane would move and there was no sound and no other mo! ving objects in the sky where I was looking.  We have a lot of airplane traffic above my house that are sometimes pretty low and that’s what I thought I was seeing.  Once I saw what looked like it had cloaked,  I immediately stopped walking and stood still to really observe what I saw.  There was nothing in the sky. I kept searching for what I saw but nothing.  I then started to try to debunk what I saw.  There are large lights in the field to light up the baseball diamonds but I cannot see any light from them from the vantage point due to being on the opposite side of the school and blocked by the building.  The object I saw would have been positioned as if they were above these lights.  So I was seeing this object above the school building and lights.  I then stepped back from where I spotted the object about 3 or 4 steps and I could see the tops of the lights.  I thought maybe there is a beam of light that is shooting upwards, but all of the lights point down to the baseball fields.  The only thing I could think of is that something flown above the lights and was illuminated for a second by a light beam, but the sky was so clear I would have been able to see the object beyond the beam.  It was also up to high for any beam of light to illuminate it.  There was no sound and it looked like a plane, and it had a few lights on it.  I thought maybe it was a crane since this is near the water and I have seen cranes nesting up on the lights before, but again it was up higher than that for it to be a crane, it was too large to be a bird like a crane also.  And again I would have been able to see it beyond any lights since the sky was so clear.  The object was like a small plane with no wings and lights. The best way I can recall the shape is the shape of the ship in the video game r-type (http://www.gamechronicles.com/reviews/ps2/rtype/ship2.gif).  The ship would have been facing the opposite direction and moving away but at the same angle.  I did stand there for a good 2 or 3 minutes without moving just so I could really see if anything else happened.  I did not see anything else after that.", "posted": "2012-03-16T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.2619", "city_longitude": "-76.4992", "latitude": 39.2619, "longitude": -76.4992 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.4992, 39.2619 ] } },

At about 9pm (+/- 30 min), I poured a glass of wine and had just sat down on the transom to watch an unbelievably clear sky – I have never, ever seen it this clear in Maryland.  I was facing west.   \n \nAfter about 10 minutes, I noticed a light appear from over my left shoulder, heading east to west.  At first I assumed it was a helicopter, because it was traveling at the altitude and speed that most helicopters seem to travel at.  The light was rather bright, roundish and mostly red in the center and some yellows and maybe greens at the edges.  My best guess is that it was about 200 yards to my left and 300-400 feet up – it’s difficult to judge distance at night, especially with a bright light, and if my distance guess is correct, it was perhaps 50-80 feet in diameter. \n \nAs this object moved westward, a second one appeared same description, and maybe 100 yards behind.  Then a few seconds later a third one, but this one was farther back, maybe three times the separation of the first two.  All three traveled westward in a straight line formation at the same speed.   \n \nAfter about a minute, the second one moved out of formation to the left and picked up speed.  He passed the leader, still heading in the same westward direction, and then when he was well in front of the leader, his light flickered, or wavered, then perhaps half a second later it flickered and dimmed and was gone.  The original ‘leader’ continued on for another second and when he reached the spot where the other one  changed, his light also wavered, and then flickered and dimmed and was gone.   \n \nThey really have my attention now.  I watched the third guy intently as he continued west and when he reached the area where the other two were, he did the same.  The light wavered, half a second later it flickered and dimmed and was gone. \n \nWhen the objects disappeared, it was like they flew into an invisible wall of grey jello, or maybe like on Star Trek, when the ship goes to warp drive.  A silly description, but that’s what it reminded me of.   \n \n I jumped up and grabbed my binoculars to search the area I had last seen them but there was nothing there. Nothing.  Also, I failed to mention that they were silent.  The wind was blowing at maybe 5 kts so there were no interfering noises that would have covered up the sound of their engines.

It was a sunny, beautiful day with bright blue skies and cottonball-like, low cumulus clouds.  I was standing on my front porch about to run over to play with friends when a bright reflective-like flash caught my attention.  I looked (east?) over the railroad tracks and saw a chrome-colored ball just sitting in the air.  I would guesstimate that it was approximatly 500-750 feet above ground.  I remember freezing in complete silence as I immediately knew that I was observing something peculiar.  I would best describe it as a ball bearing that was highly reflective, probably 30 to 40 feet in diameter.  I remember standing as still as I possibly could, because even as a kid I must admit that I was intrigued by UFOs.  I remember thinking, \"oh my God, just be still and watch it and don't blink your eyes!!\" My parents were not home as my mother got back from work usually and hour after me, so I couldn't call for anyone.  I'm sure that if someone else had been outside nearby I would have called for them to look at it with me, but strangely nobody was outside in earshot.  The object stayed completely still for approximately 30 seconds.  I remember thinking maybe it was a balloon or a Radiosonde, because I had found one of those in a nearby patch of woods years prior. I remember feeling almost paralyzed with an anxiety-like fear.  I knew I was seeing something I wasn't supposed to.  It's almost as if my body reacted to it also.  After remaining still, the object began to move laterally, from right to left.  It was almost like it was being pulled sideways on a string.  That made me even more scared because balloons usually drift up, ya know?  As it was moving to the left, it stopped,(like putting on the brakes)an! d slowly moved back to the right, and then I had this weird feeling that it knew I was watching it beacuse it changed direction again and disappeared behind a thick cloud.  I kept watching and the strangest thing happened.  I continued staring at the cloud in hopes of seeing it come out the other side, but it seemed to poke out barely from the right edge of the cloud, almost as if it were peeking to see if I was still there watching. I got the feeling that it knew I was there. (Weird!) I continued watching to see if it would come back out but it never did. The whole episode was probably less than a minute in duration. The object never moved up or down, just perfectly sideways. I never told my parents because they wouldn't have believed me anyway. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Last weekend in March 2019 I was on nightshift. I parked my patrol car along the seawall of the Gunpowder River facing North-Northeast, stopped to fill out paperwork and a coffee.  The weather was generally clear with hazy area on the horizon.  Earlier in the evening Army National Guard UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters had been flying from the nearby airfield passing over the same area conducting \"touch and go\" passes.  Flight ops had ceased about 2030(8:30pm).  I can also observe flight traffic inti Glenn Martin State Airport across the river. I have been an aviation enthusiast all my life, I KNOW conventional aircraft.  Also have flight some flight training approximately 20 years ago in single engine Cessna 152.  I happened to glance up through my windshield and an angular triangle/wedge/chevron shaped \"craft\" seemed to appear as if from behind a cloud of which there were none.  It moved w! ith absolute silence from right to left for a few seconds before disappearing the same way.  It was seemed triangular or wedge shaped, difficult to tell precisely.  The blunt end seemed to be the front as there was a bright white \"landing light\".  A single red light toward the \"front\" was visible and a few dim white lights strung along.  Again, NO SOUND.  I am familiar with the engine & rotor blade sounds.  The Blackhawk at that altitude would have made quite a racket.  It was approximately 3 inches long held at arm's length and traveled about 6 inches.  I have only confided with one other co-worker and that was recently.  I have hesitated to make any sort of official report for the obvious reasons.  I have also tried to convince myself that I saw a UH-60 returning late as the red position light would have been in about that same spot, but my professional training and experience and \"gut\" feeling says no.

Thus, the craft was off the ground no more than five stories. \n \nThe aircraft itself was silent, and had a few lights.  While I forget the colors (I want to say blue and red) and their exact placement.  The aircraft was absolutely silent and had a black exterior which was probably its material and not paint.  The aircraft had no markings of any country.  The only company that has the ability to use the airspace within this area is Northrop.  They do not mark test aircraft. \n \nAt its front end this craft had large, red hued dome protruding from its bottom, similar to a UAV camera dome.  This may have housed a IR camera that was testing therm-imaging designed for use through cloud cover (see DARPA current special projects' webpage).   There may have been antenna housed therein, as other aircraft designs has such domes as containing communication/monitoring antenna.  It did not appear to have any heat trails, but the fast moving clouds around it that day made it hard to observe and distinguish (if any).  There were around four to eight rectangles in the back of the craft, and was probably of a rotatory motor design.  While there was certainly enough room for a person to potentially be inside, from my vantage point it did not seem like there was even standing room in the mid-area of the plane.

We both saw it from inside of our car. \n \nWe were driving back home to Montgomery County in Maryland from Howard County in Maryland on Route 108. We were driving from the east to the west, specifically from the northeast to the southwest, more or less. \n \nSEE MAP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Route_108    I believe we were still in Howard county around the town of Clarksville - or Highland - when we saw the UFO on the right side of our car - the passenger side. \n \nIt was not very far away from us, as there were some tall power lines - or a cell tower of some kind - off the road in the field to the distance from us on the right of our car and a bit ahead of us as we travelled toward / by it on the left. It's hard to tell if it was one tower or a series of power line towers - but I will look more closely the next time we drive by and see what it actually is - and exactly where it is in relation to the road (Route 108). \n \nThe UFO was moving toward the tower - and then STOPPED! It stopped by the tower right after we both noticed it up in the sky. It was NOT very far away from us. \n \nMy girlfriend asked, \"What is THAT?!\" ... I saw it, too, at the same time and also said, \"Yeah, what IS that?!\" ... \"It's not a plane, I can tell you that.\" she added, as she rolled down the window to try to hear any sounds coming from it. I slowed down the car. Neither of us heard anything at all. Then I said, \"It's not a helicopter, either, because I can't hear anything - and that's too big to be a helicopter - and planes don't just STOP like that.\"  It had red and green lights that were slowly going on and off. The lights were the first things we both noticed before seeing the object itself. It appeared horizontally long, like a mettalic cigar in the sky by the tower. \n \nThen my girlfriend said, \"I have a creepy feeling. We should speed up. Whatever that is, I have never seen anything do that before.\"  So, I sped up, and as I did so, the object began to move again and was heading in OUR direction. My girlfriend said, \"It's coming this way, toward the road. ... GO!\"  So I went even faster, and she took her seatbelt off to look at it pass over the car and off behind us in the direction of the area behind my side of the car - back from the area of Howard county where we were coming from, back in the northeast direction sort of. \n \nShe looked at it as it sped off quickly, and the lights disapperared - and then the object itself disappeared. \n \nThere was no sound of a helicopter or an airplane going over us from up above as you would normally hear. \n \nThen it was gone - and we continued to drive back home. \n \nWhat WAS that?!  Do you know?  Has anyone else reported seeing such a thing on that evening?  Thank you very much!

I recently have not scene a UFO but I have had experiences in the past worth wording. \n \nIn the late 60's  Im thinking 1969 I would of been 8 standing in our front yard in Mt Washinton Maryland with my father,mother and next older brother we saw what looked like a cigar shaped balloon with what we thought was a person on a bicycle making a propeller move this craft.It was not too far away..less than a quarter mile,but we kind of had trouble making it out.It was not a plane and now I realize this was not a bicycle powered balloon either.Next years later age 13? I found myself outside my house in Towson Maryland in my underware at around 4am wondering why Im out here..I never have had a problem with sleep walking...nothing strang seemed like it had happened. Many years later 35 now I was living at a friends house in Mt washington Maryland ...my room in the basement I may have been abducted I cant tell if it was a dream or did it really happen? Im not sure but for some reason I keep recalling a very brite light like if head lights were shining in the sliding glass door in the room I was sleeping in. I think I came to in the backyard at the same time as seeing 2 dark saucers darting away over the tree tops.I went right back in and went to sleep but I felt like I had been through some trauma.It didnt seem like a big deal at that time but that dream or whatever it was keeps coming back to me.Sometime after that I developed an anal fissure which doctors thought were hemroids for the longest time...could this fissure be from a alien exam? Other strange things are the humming in my  right ear or right side of my head which started around 2/2000 that no doctor seems to have a anwser or solution for..it comes and goes and I havent had the humming for around a year now..maybe a few brief times since.Its more like an electrical hum from a large transformer.Lastly I have an obsession for ufo's and anwsers,I found out Im really good at algebra and math in general..I didnt even carry a notebook my last year of high school ..they wanted me gone..lol I was in the cop out program my last 2 yrs of high school.I did finish college with a degree in computer networking though 2002.I always have thoughts like I may have been programed or Im being monitored.If anyone else has simular experiences or you have some possible anwsers let me know.

It was very high in the air, way too high to be a helicopter with a spot light on, and was definitely not a plane.  I don't know the exact direction, but it came from the inner harbor area, and went over Patterson Park.  I asked everyone to look up at the light and everyone agreed it was definitely not a helicopter due to how high it was.  It seemed to be in the height of where commercial planes fly, but it was definitely not a plane.  It was about a pen cap size, definitely bigger than a star or a planet you can see with your eyes.  It moved slowly, it didn't zig or zag, just in a slow fluid way.  Then, towards the end, it was hard to see as it was like it was shimmering out of sight.  You really had to look for it to find it towards the end, then it just disappeared.

I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was. \n \nMy initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing. \n \nThe nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon. \n \nOver approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair. \n \nI tried to take a picture of the object with my phone's camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye. \n \nAt least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  After I went to find others and return, patrons could no longer locate the object. \n \nThe coordinates of the sighting location are 39.293' North, 76.611' West. \n \nI am currently a ((deleted--graduate)) student at a university in the Washington, DC, area.", "posted": "2010-08-30T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.31630966292135", "city_longitude": "-76.6205929588015", "latitude": 39.316309662921348, "longitude": -76.620592958801495 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.620592958801495, 39.316309662921348 ] } },

It seemed stationary at first, then it started moving very slowly side to side...as I kept looking, I could see what first appeared to be an airplane coming in from the left, but when I looked at it closer there were a series of white and red lights that were flashing side to side - it was small from my angle, but I could still tell it wasn't a plane. It came in fairly near to the first bright light and stopped in mid air, then started getting brighter and brighter like someone was turning on a light switch. They both stayed stationary, and alternated between dimming and getting stronger. Then, out of nowhere, a light just flickered out of the darkness and appeared, creating a triangle - one that started moving slowly in formation, all of the lights together. Then it changed shape a bit as each light moved, and a couple of them flickered out...weirdly, though, the one bright light was still there (it never went away until the very end). For the next hour or so, more and more ships or whatever they were would come in...at one point, there were five of them, all really bright and at all different levels of the sky. These ships, again, looked like airplanes at first - but they would change direction, go directly vertical in the air, and also stop completely and become stationary. Many times, the lights would also descend below the trees so that I couldn't see them, making them too close to the earth to be a plane. Occasionally they would all go away and I would think that it was over...only to look back out a minute later and see another triangle. About an hour and a half into this, I went out to the hallway of my dorm and called 5 more people in, all of whom saw the same thing. So with me and my roommate, that makes 7 witnesses that I now know of, and I think they were going to! tell mo re people as well. The climax was near the end, when there were actually five lights that made a large V-formation, two on either arm near the top and one in the center. It very slowly rotated, and then the lights went out. This just stopped happening about five minutes ago...actually, wait - I just looked back out again and there are two more lights back in the sky, with the same pattern as before. Overall now, this has been going on for two hours. \n \n", "posted": "2008-10-31T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.31630966292135", "city_longitude": "-76.6205929588015", "latitude": 39.316309662921348, "longitude": -76.620592958801495 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.620592958801495, 39.316309662921348 ] } },

I was sitting watching tv in my room which is in the back of the house on the second floor.  I noticed a light out of my window hovering.  The sky was bareley getting dark and I just wondered why this really bright star was out so early. I mean this this thing was brighter than a star but far a enough away to appear to look like one.  I said what the hey, it's only a star. Then it blinked a few times. I grabbed my binoculars. First there was only one object. A Plane flew by as I was looking thru binoculars, and Object 1 was joined by another object. Both immeadiately went dim. So dim I couldn't see them with my naked eyes, only with binnoculars or maybe with a video cam which I don't have. The only other way to see them was if you caught their occasional blink. They were positioned diagonal from each other, like if they were dots on a square one would be on the top left corner and the other on the bottom right. Then Object 1 moved very slowly to the top right corner of this invisible box, while Object 2 moved at the same speed to the bottom left. They moved so slow it was like they weren't moving. By now it was 21:30. I called my mother to look while I was still keeping an eye on these things. I asked her to get her notebook to write all of this down as it happened, but somehow the notebook was never retrieved.(I later drew everything on paper.) Still in the same slow manner they switched positions. So Object 1 is now in the bottom left. Then Object 2 slowly kept going in the right direction in a straight line until it disappeared into the trees. Object 1 started to blink and was joined by another which was also blinking(maybe Object 2 again I don't know). I don't know why I did it, but things got extrodinary when I grabbed a flashlight and started turning it on and off trying to mimic their blinking. They (Object 1 and Object 3) started to move slowly over top of m! y house still far away as a star. I was Looking up towards the roof, hanging out the window. At this point my mother couldn't see what I saw. Then my mother shouted look! And directly in a straight line parallel to my window as I looked straight out there were about 13 blinking lights. At this time 21:45 several planes have already passed by in which we compared the blinking lights to, but none matched. I kept on blinking my flashlight. I don't even know why. In the back of my mind I really thought they couldn't see it because it was too high up. But still more appeared. Too many to count because of the annoying blinking. Two of the blinking objects moved left in which I followed with my naked eyes only to see them meet up with a really bright one, about as bright as the very first one I saw. It was there up until 22:45 but I stopped looking at 22:15 because I got board. It was just hovering there with the other 2. The rest had gone. My mother checked on it twice, up until 22:45 til she couldn't see the bright one anymore. The first two objects had a yellow/reddish color. The bright ones were the same only brighter. The others were dim as stars but blinking enough to get your attention. Probably 1 blink every 2 seconds.", "posted": "2002-07-26T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.31630966292135", "city_longitude": "-76.6205929588015", "latitude": 39.316309662921348, "longitude": -76.620592958801495 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.620592958801495, 39.316309662921348 ] } },

It was a crystal clear night, very pleasant weather and only 1 or 2 other dog walkers out.  As we rounded the Pagoda on the home leg of our walk I was looking south and could clearly see the constellation Orion just off to the SSW.  I remember saying to myself, \"So clear, I’ll bet I can see Taurus  \n(my Zodiacal sign).\"  Started to swing my head to the west and out of the corner of my eye, approaching from the south, I saw something I cannot explain. \n \nAt least 9 amber/orange lights in formation and 3 or 4 more lights not in formation, meandering around the formation, were rapidly moving across the sky from almost due south to due north.  I was dumbfounded.  I observed this for about 15-20 seconds. \n \nThe formation consisted of 3 v-shaped flights in a chevron that was rock solid, all flew in unison.  The meanderers seemed to circle and wander around the solid chevron as they tore across the sky at incredible speed. \n \nFlabbergasted, I muttered a few expletives.  Trying to get a grip on myself I struggled to get my phone out but just as it cleared my jacket pocket the phenomenon disappeared over the horizon to the north. \n \nI looked around to see if anyone else in the park saw this.  There was nobody around except Gadget who, sensing my astonishment, looked at me with concern as if to say, “What’s up with you, ((name deleteed))?  Why so frantic?”  Completely blown away we stood there for a few moments.  I Goggled the number and called in the report to UFOReports.com right there from the park. \n \nBewildered we walked home and I made an online report of the sighting. \n \nI tried to explain it to myself most of the rest of the night. \n \nWas it reflections of street lights off my glasses?  Their color was similar to sodium vapor street lighting.  No I surmised.  I had to swivel my head from south to north to track the lights and they never wavered in their flight path.  Arrow straight the formation flew, no wavering or smearing you would expect if it was a reflection. \n \nSpace junk?  Maybe, but the formation was so solid the flight appeared to be on an intentional course.  And to have 9 lights in solid formation and 3 or for in a seemingly random formation is a mix of trajectories and not likely to be a single object that broke up on reentry.  Such junk would all follow the same path and would leave a trail of some sort.  There was no flaming trail. \n \nAircraft?  I've never seen anything move that fast in the atmosphere.  I've seen satellites, the ISS, Skylab, these moved just as fast if not faster across the sky.  The meandering lights also seemed to take a non-ballistic course and moved in ways no aircraft I know of could reproduce. \n \nSo, there you have it. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report appeared on the Jeff Rense Radio Program on March 13, 2015, in order to describe his sighting.  He also submitted a report about his sighting in Tehran, Iran, in September 1976.  At the request of this witness, a colleague of his submitted a second report for that same sighting.

Moments before the splashdown occurred (which was at exactly 2:48pm Eastern) I saw an object outside in the sky, through the southernmost of my three 2nd floor row home windows, which are facing East, and provide a very good view of the sky over Eastern Baltimore. \n \nNote: I see a tremendous amount of air traffic through these windows on a daily basis, including police and MEDEVAC helicopters, BWI air traffic (mostly making landing approaches), various private and commercial aircraft, and occasional military overflights (cargo, A-10s, etc.) I have had a lifelong interest in aircraft, have flown a Robinson R-22 helicopter, and can generally identify every aircraft I see. \n \nI first noticed this object, I would estimate, about 45-60 seconds before the splashdown at 2:48pm -- the four parachutes on the capsule were deployed, they had switched from the airborne to the the surface/ship-based camera view of the capsule coming down, and I was really trying to pay attention to what was going on on my TV, as I had been watching the stream for a good 45+ minutes, waiting for the safe return. But something about this object out of the corner of my eye, going by in the sky outside, absolutely demanded my attention -- something about it struck me as \"off\" and worthy of more attention, even though I was distracted by the Space X capsule return going on on my TV. The television was literally saying things like \"the spacecraft is about to return,\" and similar statements. \n \nI got up and walked several feet to my window, and looked out at the object. I was completely blown away by what I saw -- it was a highly-reflective/super-shiny ellipsoid, with a clearly-defined surface that looked shiny like a finely-polished steel. I interpreted it as seeing a traditional disc-shaped UFO, seen from the side, but from my point of view it was a longer oval, or ellipsoid. \n \nToward the upper-right corner of this aircraft-sized object, there was an ongoing, irregular flashing or glinting of yellowish light. At first I thought it might be a reflection of the Sun, but for the whole (estimated) 60-90 seconds I saw this thing flying North/Northeast (I would say generally toward Towson/Parkville), there was this irregular glinting, visually evident even when the object was a speck out in the distance in the Northeastern sky near the horizon. \n \nAs I said, it was clearly the size of an aircraft -- not a balloon. It traveled at a consistent speed and in a consistent direction, perhaps roughly the speed a helicopter would fly at. It did not bob around or make any sudden movements, or apparent changes to altitude or heading. \n \nI did not think to photograph the object, because frankly I was utterly stunned by what I was seeing, and the odd synchronicity of seeing a UFO (my only sighting in my ~44 years) at the exact moment of a spacecraft returning to Earth on TV, with the TV issuing a fairly relevant narration for what I was seeing out of my living room window. It was very, very odd. I have had a lifelong interest in UAP, and this is the only thing I have seen that I would remotely describe as a UFO -- and it was not a speck, not a dot, not a light, not something vague -- it was a super-shiny silver disc thing flying by in the middle of the afternoon, totally casually. \n \nMy estimation is that it was flying relatively low, definitely under a few thousand feet. My sense is it was traveling between my location in Baltimore's Abell neighborhood, and Lake Montebello. I think it was probably near Loch Raven Blvd. I would estimate it was maybe 30-50 feet in diameter? The size of an aircraft, but I think closer to a smaller plane or a helicopter, versus an airliner. No obvious features, just a very shiny/reflective metallic surface, making that weird glinting flash. \n \nAbout a week later I had the idea to see if aircraft flight data is available online, and learned that ADS-B was at that point fully in service (I'd heard about it years earlier, but didn't know it had been fully rolled out). Because I knew the precise several-minute window of my sighting, due to its overlap with the Space X splashdown, I was able to \"rewind\" to the airspace at the time using Flightradar 24. I saw absolutely nothing, at all, flying over the entire Baltimore 495 area, for a few minutes on either side of the 2:48pm Eastern splashdown. I checked the time many times, to make sure I wasn't making an error in an Eastern to UTC conversion (Flightradar24 historical data is recorded in UTC). Nothing, within the entire circumference of the 495 beltway. \n \nI reported this sighting to MUFON about a week after it occurred, but decided recently I would also submit the report to NUFORC in the spirit of completeness.", "posted": "2021-12-19T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.31630966292135", "city_longitude": "-76.6205929588015", "latitude": 39.316309662921348, "longitude": -76.620592958801495 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.620592958801495, 39.316309662921348 ] } },

They were shaped similarly to vacation cruise ships, albeit much longer and more slender,  and   because of the perspective, must have in actuality been a lot larger, certainly much larger than the plane I was in.

They were subtlely lit. \n \n My mind totally tried to rationalize what I saw, because they weren't like any common aircraft at all.

To the right of the helicopter (helicopter was heading west) I saw a round object moving slowly thru the sky heading north.  The helicopter didn’t appear to be chasing it, as it just flew by and kept going west (though quickly fell behind the house/tree line so I don’t know if it turned back towards the object while out of my view.)  Very rough guess, but comparing to the helicopter that was at about 1000 feet, it had to be comparable in size to the helicopter, maybe slightly bigger.  I live near an airport, and see helicopters a lot, this was just an average size common helicopter.  (local news and police take off from there, and it just looked like the standard news or police copter, nothing military).  This airport is a Maryland National Guard base as well though (in Middle River Maryland.)  The object was slowly moving to the north, while slowly rotating.  Would say approximately 1500 to 2000 feet in the sky.  It was circular in shape, but if you think of it as a burger, it was round with a small bite taken out of it.  As it rotated, the side without the “bite”, it was reflecting a lot of sunlight off the top of the object.  As it rotated the “bite” toward me, it was reflecting much less sunlight.  That was how I could really tell it was a spinning object, but indented on one side (i.e. the bite).

By the time I adjusted the screen brightness, got my camera app open and looked up, it was gone.  With how slow it was moving, I would have expected it to still be there.  I’m so upset I did not take out my phone sooner.  It had to have moved quickly out of view, I would say it took me about 30 – 40 seconds to get my screen brightness adjusted, and get the camera app open, and look back up. \n \n It could not have been a plane, it was moving far too slowly.  A plane would have fallen from the sky at that slow of speed.  I did not see any helicopter blades on top, no wings, nothing.

My dad never wanted to be late so we left a little after 7pm to make sure we made it there in plenty of time.  Our house is on a small hill near the end of our block.  It was twilight to dark.  As we left the house and started walking down the front steps down to our car – we saw this black object floating just barely above the tree tops. \n \nIt was enormous and hardly moving.  It spanned from one end of our block to the other end.  I don’t know how long our block is but the object was more than the length of our block and there are 6 three story colonial houses between our house and the end of the block and the object was long enough to cover them all.  It was wide covering houses on both sides of the street.  The object was also tall or thick (maybe one story or more thick) and not aerodynamic at all.  There is no way that should be flying.  It was so large that we could never see the far side of it.  We really only could ever see 2 sides of it so it could be a rectangle or a triangle. \n \nWe walked down the steps and into the middle of our street and stood directly underneath it.  It was very close nearly touching the tree tops (large oak trees in our neighborhood).  It was a matte black and blocked out the sky from our view because it was so massive.  It had lights on the underside -some large, some small, but the lights were dull and not bright.  I can’t remember where the lights were but know some were different colors.  The side of the object had a window like opening which had dim lights. \n \nWith an object flying so close, it should have been loud but this object didn’t make a sound but you could sort of feel it in your chest.  Even blimps make sounds but this object just didn’t make a sound. \n \nWe stood directly underneath it for several minutes looking up and then it slowly drifted up the side street next to our house.  It went from moving straight ahead to moving at a 90 degree angle without turning.  We kept walking with it up the side street while it was directly overhead.  It was gliding so slowly that it was easy to keep walking with it. \n \nWe could have kept walking with it but my dad said that he didn’t want to be late for the concert and we had to go.  In the end, we watched the object for about 15 minutes.  I didn’t want to go but we did.  When we got into the car, I asked my dad what it was and he said that he didn’t know and didn’t want us to talk about it ever again.  I tried to bring it up several times and he made it clear that we were to never discuss it.   \n \nYears went by without talking about it– when my dad was dying I asked him about it and he couldn’t remember it happened.  I thought maybe it was all in my mind so a few years after my dad died I asked my mom if she remembered and she did.  This made me both relieved and uneasy.  We’ve talked about it several times since then.  My father was a physician, my mother is a nurse.  I am a medical researcher. \n \nWhile I wasn’t afraid while we were watching the object (it was oddly peaceful), those moments seeing it have haunted me almost every day since.  I’ve been uneasy sleeping at my house since that initial night and have had to sleep with a light on only when I’m there.  Every time I felt the slightest low hum, I rushed to my bedroom window to see if it is there. I’ve since moved away but my mom still lives there.  I moved to a very large city and oddly I sleep better in this large city than at my childhood home. \n \nI can be contacted by an investigator if needed. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

This craft was bigger around than the houses and the bottom was lit up, either one big light or a whole lot of lights to light the whole bottom up.  then i remember running down my yard and following about 5 or 6 of them to this field we called Sandy Hill.   \n \nWe had a very long skinny backyard and at the bottom we could access this trail that went through the woods and at one end it ended up at the stores at the top of Freeway Rd. and at the other end of the trail was this huge giant sand field we called Sandy Hill.  These objects were headed toward sandy hill.   \n \nAfter this experience i remember my mother saying that she was awake and floating overtop her bed, my dad said it was probably some type of spiritual dream, but she insisted it was not a dream and she was definitely awake.   \n \nI remember my brother coming into my room, terrified cause he had all these little men all around his bed.  I remember our television could not get a picture at all and my dad and his friend got on the roof to check our antennea and it had been completely broken off by something and could not be used anymore so they took it down and it layed in our backyard for quite some time and we use the rabbit ears antennea that you use to put ontop of the television.   \n \nI remember when i would get near the t.v. or touch it the picture would completely get static and you could not see the picture, i would play around and touch the t.v. quite a bit and my parents would make comments.  I remember for some reason that i started waking up with these splitting headaches that would make me throwup every morning for quite a while.  I regretted waking up in the morning cause i didn't want the headache.   \n \nI remember something happened to my right shin bone.  What? I just remember i use to roll my sock down and roll my pant leg up so nothing would touch this spot on my leg.  This spot was extremely sore, like down to the bone, but no bruise or mark at all.   \n \nI remember for some reason this huge thing was really scary and this little thing was scary too but not as scary as the big one. I remember laying on my right side, and remember a needle thing or something. To this day i still don't know what the big and little things were.   \n \nIn the early 90's i called my brother and asked him if he remembered the little men and he didn't but he does believe in ufo's and has seen them throughout his life.   \n \nI remember a dream i had in the 90's that had to do with my leg.  I was laying on an operating table, lifted my head up and seen my leg open in the exact spot where it was sore when i was a kid, and i seen these so called doctors or something around me, mainly seeing eyes around me.  I remember thinking i should get my leg checked.  Never did.   \n \nI have many, many dreams of ufo's and have seen objects while definitely awake.  I find this subject the most fascinating of all time.  \n \nAlso in the early 90's i began investigating my dreams and memories and went to the local library here in cumberland, i asked if they could find out if there were any ufo sighting in balto.  \n \nin the early to mid 70's and i ended up getting articles from The Baltimore Sun and The News American dated October 18,1973 about ufo sightings in baltimore and surrounding counties.  This confirmed my ufo sighting for me. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting event is approximate.

We often see and hear helicopters as we are in an urban area and just a few blocks from a major shock trauma center so there is much activity.  This night however as I sat on my deck I noticed to my left in the eastern sky what appeared to be a low helicopter heading west, the bright light on it however was larger than normal and was of a light green color which I’ve never seen in the three years of living here.  As it got closer to being overhead it appeared to be oval shaped and I realized there was absolutely NO NOISE, no engine sound, and no propeller sound.  All at once the light seemed to flash one time and go dark, completely dark, nothing, not a sound.  I mean it just went out as if someone had turned off a switch.  It was incredible.

It stopped in the sky in the clouds n got bright as the sun.  it was still dark out so it lit up the sky.  this was very frightening.  it looked like a black canopy with a hole cut in it with light on the other side. I thought it might b a nuke.  Then I saw two fighter jets fly toward it then it dissapeared.  The smoke trail it left was incredible. Figure eights, zig-zags, then at the top a perfect 3d cube.  None of our phones would work to take a pic.  Well bout five to nine fighter jets began flying straight up then down and all over all morning.  I was in seven 11 parkin lot n pointed them out to bystanders, who at the time were oblivious.  they were shocked at the site of the fighter jets.  I was so excited by the incident, that i called my dad to tell him of the events, n to c if he could see the jets.  I called my exgirlfriend who lives in philadelphia, n she said there were a bout 8 fighter jets in the sky up there, this was around 9a.m.  My dad called back and said there had been a newsflash of the reports.  The media said that the government shot off two missles off of an island off of virginia.  They made no mention of why, and made no other mention of it.  They blamed the smoke trail on the weather.  The smoke trail itself was incredible because it sat in the air for a good ten minutes.   \n \ni have met six other people than my friends that witnessed the same event.

It was evening and dark but not too late – I would venture to guess it was bet. 6:30 and 7:30pm.  We saw something that astonished us in the night sky.  Looking NW we saw a huge vessel that was not very high in the sky, over the field in the back of our house.  We lived on a court and there was a 3 or 4 acre field behind our house.  The UFO was about 500 feet up, moving very slowly toward the SE, noiselessly.  I have a very good picture in my mind of it – it largely resembled the typical UFO spacecraft, just like the “Jupiter Two” from the “Lost in Space” series.  On the bottom of the craft were large, lit panels. \n \n We all remarked upon this – how amazing it was to see.  We knew instantly that what we were seeing was otherworldly.  It was so close, so large, and moving without sound.  After it departed, at a constant but slow speed, I don’t know why we didn’t just all go back inside and call the police.  I do remember that we went inside to tell my father what we had seen (he was home babysitting my little brother), but we then just proceeded to go on to church.  We all compared notes in the car ride to church, “Yep, it looked just like the Jupiter Two” we agreed.  At church we asked folks if they had seen it – only one or two people said they had heard there was some kind of large weather balloon in the area that was being tested.  This was no weather balloon.  It was directly over the field in our backyard. \n \n I know what I saw.  I’d love to see it again sometime.  Hopefully I’ll have the presence of mind to videotape next time!  (I do not know the exact date of this event.  I thought the year had to be ’73 or ’74.

I remember the weather being a cool summer evening; remember the grass being cool on my bare feet, light warm breeze, just before dark.  I was in my Aunts kitchen when my mother took my hand and followed my aunt into her back yard where the other children were, everyone was standing still, staring about 4-6 ft maybe at one, maybe more, flat oval shaped,  glowing softly sphere, that was silent. The colors inside reminded of the colorful swirls you see in a soap bubble. I remember thinking to myself if I could touch it my hand would go right through it. It felt like it was watching us too. I stood there holding my mother’s hand, motionless, like everyone for what it seemed like an hour, more likely 15-20minutes. I remember hearing someone whisper “what is it” but no one answered, maybe for fear it would go away, we all just stared in silence, then all of a sudden…like a camera flash, it was gone? I never recall our families ever talking about it? Maybe the older ones did. \n \nI’m now 45 years old, recently, talking family and friends about UFO’s unexplained things etc...

I was closing up the house getting ready to bed and I saw it from my kitchen window in the western sky.A very, very bright white light. I went outside on my driveway and observed it for several minutes. It went to the north and the back to the south several times. Seemingly not at a blind speed but faster than any aircraft that flies in these areas. It hovered for awhile and then it dawned on me to go in and get my cell phone to record, and I did. I filmed it for awhile then it burst into a orange circle of light rotating counter clockwise..pulsing all the while. It had in the center what seemed to be a more solid shape or object. It really isn’t well defined. It did that for awhile before it went back to it’s original shape. Hovered some more before it was joined by another and then the both disappeared over the tree tops.

Looking NW towards Urbana/Frederick area, I saw 2 bright orange lights side by side & low on the horizon.  They were coming straight towards my location in Monrovia, MD, at a steady pace and stopped and hovered for about a minute maybe 1 mile from my house.  I estimate their altitude to be around 1000 feet.  Then the first light ascended straight up at a silent but steady pace - the orange light turned white & looked like a distant star, and then it was gone.  Then the second light did the same thing.  I watched for a few more minutes when I noticed 2 more orange lights low on the horizon coming towards me.  One light was faster than the other and it seemed to slow down 2 or 3 times to let the slower light catch up.  These 2 lights stopped and hovered in the same place as the first 2 and then ascend straight up one at a time just like t! he first 2. \n \nI watched for a few more minutes and saw nothing more and went inside.  After about 5 minutes, I told my wife about my \"weird\" sighting.  My oldest son overheard my story, and as kids do, wanted to say that I was crazy, so he went outside onto our back deck.  As soon as he got outside, he screamed for everybody to come here now......  Six of us went out onto the deck and we all saw that there were now 7 bright orange lights evenly spaced in a vertical zig-zag pattern at the same spot where the previous 4 lights had ascended straight up.  One by one, all 7 lights ascended straight up until out of sight. \n \nThis was really weird and the first time I had ever seen anything like this - but there were 6 witnesses to this event.  I doubt if many people saw this because it was dinnertime on Thanksgiving night and the Redskins were playing the Cowboys on TV at this time.  The total event lasted about 25 minutes - it was over around 6:10 pm. \n \nAs an interesting side note, I offer this.  During this timeframe, I saw no airplanes in the vicinity this entire time.  I live within about 50 miles of 3 major airports (Reagan National, Dulles and BWI) as well as several smaller airports such as Frederick Municipal , Hagerstown, Martinsburg and Montgomery Airpark) - there always seems to be planes in the airspace above us at all different altitudes - except for this night and time.  Within 5 minutes of the last orange light disappearing, there were planes again. \n \nWe tried to take pictures, but nothing was clear.  However, there is a You Tube video titled \"Family of UFO's Flying over Baltimore\" recorded on 1-31-2016 that shows identical orange lights to what the six of us witnessed.

Well, my thoughts changed a little more than a year ago. \n \nI was in my father's home in Baltimore, about 11 o'clock at night. I was looking out the window as I always do at the street life, waiting for Saturday Night Live to come on at 11:30. I was the only one home at the time. As I was looking around, I saw a helicopter take off, very silent. It seemed much more silent than a normal helicopter...but, oh well. Anyway, as I tracked its movement I saw out in the dark of night two lights slowly making their way across the sky. I thought it was other helicopters, or planes, or anything like that. But then, the lights vanished. I looked again, and they were gone. The helicopter I saw before was making its way towards the area where the lights were, and it had turned it's search light on. Then, about...say...300 feet from where they appeared, the two lights came on again, but there was this haze around them, and they were heading away from the helicopter. But, they were going straight up in the sky. Then they went down, left, and finally went out again. I thought it was just some sort of light on the ground making this, but the helicopter was now flying as fast as it could towards the lights. \n \nI saw another helicopter off in the distance heading towards the lights, it was coming from the opposite direction of the first one.

The two hazy lights returned quickly right near the second helicopter, then went away. \n \nFinally, I didn't see anything for a few minutes, but then as the helicopters were about to meet, two hazy lights that seemed to come from the ground shot up into the sky, and vanished. They looked like the two lights I had been watching. \n \n I went to the police station the next day to ask what the helicopters were going after, but they said that no helicopters took off last night. I believe firmly to this day that what I witnessed was something, and something that someone didn't want to tell me about. \n \n I also did receive about 5 calls within the next week, and when I picked up, the person on the other line hung up.

These identical observations were made by me(about age 9), my then best friend,age 11,and his mother,then about age 45.  She is the one who found the newspaper article the next day,which I have never taken the time to attempt to relocate since then, but which forever impressed this sighting in my memory,since independently confirmed and shared by many other complete strangers in the area written up in the Baltimore Sunpapers(or News American). The date and time is approximate,but was approximately the height of summer,l958. I have never had any other sighing before nor since,and did not connect it to UFOs per se because back then they were described as\"flying saucers\",and I had never heard of triagular UFOs,only discs or alleged cigar shapes, until the l990s,when photos of the triagular objects over Belgium and elsewhere first came to my attention. Unlike some other reports of triangular sightings,however,there was no central light,but instead merely one small white lite at each apex of each triangle. Other than the absence of a central(fourth)light,what we saw appeared identical to the Belgian triangles caught on film in the l990s. No other detail could be made out with respect to the objects. I've decided to report this after all these years in the hope that if enough people make enough reports,then the scientific community and the appropriate authorities will study these phenomenon seriously. Also,someone should check the archives of the local newspapers for the summer of l958 which should substantiate that many persons reported the same observations at the same time,totally independently of one another. Our group of three had not made any report of what we saw that night to anyone,but were genuinely puzzled at the time,and surprised the next day that so many other unknown  persons reported similar phenomena the previous night at the same time in the same area,over northern and northwestern Baltimore County. In those days Randallstown,where our sighing occurred,was semi-rural and therefore relatively free of City light pollution. It was a warm,clear,dry,starry,moonless night,which may help pin down the time of month,and will remain vivid in my recollection forever,since what we saw was nothing like I've ever seen before nor since,except for the Belgian photos from the early l990 sightings,and was definitely not manmade aircraft due to their flight characteristics:apparent large size,lack of sound,low slow coordinated,level,uniform straightline motion, and other appearance as described above. These two objects continued north not changing speed nor direction until over the horizon.This is all I recall observing,and would have thought no more of it but for the aforesaid newspaper reports by so many others the next day,on the theory that all of us could not be mistaken nor confused at what we saw,i.e.controlled silent low flying triangles in formation,maintaining equal distance from one another,inconsistent with any known technology,nor any natural phenomena whatsoever.The lights did not flash like a plane,nor change color, nor intensity,nor their positions relative to one another while continuing a uniform motion northward of our backyard vantage point. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

We drove out of the city and off into a farm field where there were no lights around so we could see the stars clearly.  It was difficult at first to actually see the stars because it was a cloudy night and we were only 15 minutes away from the bright lights of the city.  As we searched for Andromeda, we all started commenting on the orange light that hung right above our horizon dew North.  The light appeared to be moving, but after a few minutes we agreed it was still and that it could possibly be a radio tower or fixated light of some sort. \n \nWe tried to get a closer look with my telescope but all we could make out was a grainy, orange glow. (Definitely in the shape a circle- we were able to see the shape with our telescope set at 25x) I attempted to use my phone to zoom in on the object but it was still blurry so I just gave up.  In our opinion it was not a star because it was so close to our horizon and the brightness of the city wouldn’t have allowed us to see a star that low.  It was lower than any observable star in the sky. \n \nThe clouds South of us were moving in so quickly that we could literally watch them roll over the horizon covering the stars.  We got distracted by this and turned around for a second, when we turned back around the object was completely gone.  We did see a plane flying through the sky (at about the same altitude) but it was definitely not the same object because it had a red blinking light and it was definitely a plane. \n \nAfter we all realized that the object was gone we got such an eerie sensation that we just had to get out of there.  We decided to drive down the road a little bit to make sure it wasn’t a radio tower with an orange light on it- we drove a mile and realized there was no tower, still feeling afraid we turned around and booked it back to the city.  We want to go back to the farm field at some point this week to make sure there is not a radio tower there.

They were hovering over power lines, and stayed in place for 30-40 minutes. \n \nMy neighbor called 911, and police arrived.  They stared up at the sky along with the rest of us.

I wonder if anyone else picked this object up on their door cameras as it flew in an SW-to-NE direction across Frederick. \n \nI just submitted this report to the MUFON organization: \n \n\"I caught the video on my ring video, which is set up to detect motion; the object was high-speed, changed direction slightly while in flight, and did not make a sound as it traveled a distance of over a mile in less than 5 seconds. I am not sure, but there seems to have been a bright reflection on the roofs of cars approximately 400 feet from me as the object passed overhead, which gives credence to this being a physical object that was giving off intense light and rapidly changing direction as it flew over my house early this morning. Please see the attached video.\" \n \nThe object may have triggered my neighbors driveway security lights.", "posted": "2022-06-22T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.41715472527473", "city_longitude": "-77.41379032967032", "latitude": 39.417154725274727, "longitude": -77.41379032967032 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.41379032967032, 39.417154725274727 ] } },

I pulled over to the side of the road(now facing east on Beardshill Rd.)to see what was going on if possible.My son and I were watching(facing west)the helicopter.To the north you could see a light airplane practicing flight maneouvers at the Harford Co.Airpark when I happened to look to the northeast and was startled to see a low flying vehicle(disk or saucer shaped)passing over head.I asked my son to look.He acknowledged by saying \"What is that?\" I replied,\"It looks like a flying saucer!\" The vehicle was approx. 500 to 750 ft. above us. As it passed overhead it made no noise whatsoever.It was just floating from N.E. to S.W.,following I-95 toward Baltimore. I would say the vehicle was approx.50 to 100 ft.in diameter,domed at the top and bottom with a dark ring around outside diameter.I saw no windows,engines,or wings.The color scheme was that of the space shuttle. The vehicle colors were bone white(top&bottom)and a visibly black tiled ring around the outer edge.You could see the top of the vehicle because as it moved away from us following I-95,it became level with our eyesight.We were standing at one of the highest elevations in Aberdeen.As this vehicle moved away getting smaller,I turned and looked to see another identical vehicle floating overhead. I told my son to look.\"WOW!\",he said. We saw six of these vehicles that day. As one vehicle moved out of our sight to the S.W., one would appear from the N.E..They were following each other in an inline group.I would say they were traveling at approx.75 to 100 mph. The next day at work I talked about what I saw but nobody I talked to saw what I did.The Md.State helicopte! r pilot& copilot had to see these vehicles,as the helicopter was facing to the S.E.,and these vehicles would have crossed their \"path\".I can say that I do not think that these vehicles were extraterrestrial,but manmade in nature.Unless we truly do have alien technology! They were so close to us overhead that they resembled the same texture of material and color scheme that the space shuttle is made out of.I have stood next to the shuttle at Kennedy Space Center.Except for their shape,they do resemble each other.It was really uncanny.My son dosen't remember much about what he saw that day except that they were saucer shaped, but I am sure that some others in Aberdeen had to see these vehicles especially those helicopter pilots from the state police.I found out later they were searching for two robbery suspects at that building.Also I must note that I saw these same vehicles on the T.V. show \"Sightings\" twice.

I pulled out my phone and started recording, and after zooming in, the object appeared as a white sphere on video that almost pulsated appeared to grow in size and shrink back down over seconds.  This all appeared to be at a far distance.  It moved gently to bouncing in no consistent pattern around the sky in a small vicinity.  The Sphere then became hard to track and seemingly vanished and then a smaller black object appeared very close in the sky.  It was either the same object or a second different object.  Over the next few minutes the bright lighted object appeared and disappeared.  Because of the distance they were easy to loose focus of, but then bright lighted UFO would prominently appear again.  My second video featuring the Bright lighted UFO is ended after the object seemingly vanishes into a specific direction.  There is a small local nearby airport geared for recreational flying, along with drones being used around the area.  The movement and coloration allowed me to ration past these explanations for the object.  I filmed 2 planes flying by very close to where I recorded the object as a reference.  (At first, thinking the planes may be investigating, however not moving fast as a jet, making them seem recreational.)", "posted": "2018-09-27T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.5303", "city_longitude": "-76.4356", "latitude": 39.5303, "longitude": -76.4356 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.4356, 39.5303 ] } },

I’ve never had much cause to believe in them or disbelieve, but I’ve never personally witnessed anything that I couldn’t explain in the sky. \n \nThe last few nights, my family and I have been watching something strange going on. I’ve tried finding cosmic explanations for it, but this doesn’t fit the pattern. I’m reporting it- feel free to use or discard the information as you see fit. \n \nWe’re only able to see this at night. There’s something stationary in the sky with lights going in a circular pattern from right to left.. they then blink several times and start the pattern all over again. If the moon were a clock, it’d be sitting at the 8 o’clock position in relation to the moon.  It continues this pattern for several hours, then around 11:30pm, something shoots off from it.. it looks like a bright white light.. it goes much faster than any falling star we’ve seen, and it zips over into the big dipper and fades out. This is the fourth night we’ve watched this happen. \n \nI live in northeastern Maryland. I called friends in Baltimore who also saw the same thing happen. There were 8 of us here and 10 more people in Baltimore who all saw the same thing. \n \nAs I said before, I’ve never seen anything like this, and I honestly don’t know if this is just some technology we haven’t seen before, or if this is something unusual. I just thought I’d pass this along on our behalf. Until this incident, I had no idea there actually was a place to report this kind of thing.

College degree.  I am a business development executive in the technology industry for many years now.  Have never filed a report like this before. \n \nTonight, a little over an hour ago, I was standing in my driveway with my neighbor and my 6 year old son.  We had a small fire going in a fire ring at the end of my driveway, and were standing around it.  It was chilly tonight, but the sky was crystal clear, not a cloud in sight, a thousand stars, and a half moon somewhat low in the sky.  A nice night to hang out with a neighbor. \n \nI looked up at the stars from my vantage point.  I was facing southeast, the moon was to my right slightly, my eye caught movement and was not immediately identified, but after a few seconds of trying to triangulate at what had caught my attention, I noticed an occlusion of stars in a somewhat broad chevron v shaped pattern, moving forward as you would naturally envision a chevron flying.  Soon after, I also discerned a slight, very dim light blue glue surrounding the chevron, and the chevron was an ever so subtle different shade of black than the surrounding night sky.  It was close, it had no lights or strobes or anything. It was very hard to see. But it was unquestionably there. It made no noise.  It appeared to be at a height of at least 10,000 feet, and possibly as high as 50,000 feet, it appeared to be moving at about 500 mph, directly south.  It could have been a little bigger than a 747, or an aircraft carrier, depending on how high it was. The glow was what really freake! d me out. \n \nI tracked it for a short time, but it faded with light from the moon as it neared that body in the night sky. \n \nI commented to my neighbor and my son that I had just seen a UFO, and laughed. I described it to them, they both looked up, but it was long gone. I told my wife when I came in. \n \nI have no evidence, no proof, but I don't make up stories on this stuff, nor am I a UFO nut. I am open minded. Perhaps it was an air force secret plane. All I know is that it was very weird. \n \nAdditional information.  We live under a major air traffic lane of aircraft flying southeast from Philly, New York, Boston, Europe.  We see aircraft flying all the time, in a very predictable pattern, with aircraft I easily identify. The sighting was not in this pattern, nor was it a commercial or military aircraft.

I could feel pressure all over my physical body as if I were being held in place and held down, even on a molecular level. There was a sound all around that was reminiscent of the sound a babies heart makes in its mother's womb... very loud in my ears and it was externally audible.  It felt like my life force was being sucked up, and In my mind's eye I saw 3 figures sitting above me and siphoning my energy somehow.  I became very angry that my free will had been attacked.  I willed myself to fend them off by saying over and over that they had no right and they would be blown to oblivion. (prayer did not help at all, it was only when I made it known that I was the ONLY authority over myself that they stopped and ran away)  All of a sudden, my eyes clicked open and the pressure was relieved.  But then there were heavy footsteps on my roof and the doors of my armoire flew open and some items flew out of it onto the floor.  I heard noise in the tree outside my widow and I went to look outside to see 3 figures heading in the direction of Main street (I lived across from St Margaret's church at the time). Needless to say I was freaked out and could not sleep anymore that night. \n \nMy brother lived across from Bel Air High School on Heigh and Kenmore and was also paralyzed that night.  The difference in his experience is that his friends broke his door down so they could all go see the \"UFO\" that was over the school.  My brother told me he was paralyzed and could not respond to his friends at the door, who then became alarmed enough to bust it open.  When they enetered his apartment he was able to move again.  They all ran outdoors to see the ship/craft/ufo. \n \nThe next day I had bruises on my legs and back which were not there the day before and also some small scars on my ankles that had not been there before. \n \nI realize this happened 26 years ago.  But I will never forget the feeling and the experience with these beings.  Of course being in between 2 military bases, Bel Air is a perfect place for things like this to happen.

At approximatly 8:30 one of the students on the sidelines pointed out 2 white lights 4 inches apart at arms length over the school building.  The crowd watching the game had their backs to the object.  There was no sound.  I thought at first it was a security light on top of the roof of the building. The appearance fo the lights was similar to metal halide lights. We observed the lights for several minutes. I at first suspected it was a helicopter and was looking for the navigation lights, but did not see any other than the white lights.  The focus of the lights was on the game.  After several minutes the lights began moving slowly towards us.  Altitude was low probably around 200 ft if that. Distance was about 400 yards.  No sound was noted the wind direction was from the east which should have carried the sound towards us.  The craft moved forward for about 30 seconds ( very slowly) then turned completly on its side and changed direction from NW to SE. The craft flew on its side with wingtip down wingtip up and nose to SE. As it turned I was able to make out the shape of the triangle. The craft was very large.  A couple of cessnas flew at the same altitude that night in the same area, and 5 of them would have fit into the wingspan of this craft. Also we had no problem hearing the other aircraft in the area. The craft flew on its side the legnth of the school building then turned on its back and flew away I have been waiting to see if any further reports would turn up.  A number of people who saw the object said it had to be an aircraft ( reason being is that they didn't believe in UFO's)  However, because of the size and the manuevering capability demonstrated I feel that it was definetly something unusual.  The actual object was only visible when it turned on its side.   There was no sound from the aircraft during the entire sighting. The craft was in back of the main crowd, there were only about 11 people in a position to see it.  we were unable to get any photos of it.  It would have been difficult because of the stadium lights. The craft did not appear threatening at any point in time. We didn't feel afraid but were excited and elated to see it. No unusual smells were noted and no missing time was experienced. ( When I first noted the object I kept an eye on hte stadium clock just in case) There were aircraft in the area, however none were there at the same time as the object. Mostly single engine type craft were out that night. This sighting was reported to Major Filer and MUFON since I'm one of their investigators.

My best guess is that this was somewhere over Constant Friendship or Bel Air.  I was thoroughly intrigued by this light,  I knew it was not an airplane or helicopter.  I live in Havre de Grace and everyone in Harford County is familiar with Aberdeen Proving Ground, and we are even more familiar with their aircraft and flight plans.  Also in the time I observed this I counted about 4-5 planes go by in that direction.   I could assume these were planes passing because they all had the flashing red or red and green lights, as well as, they seemed to maintain a constant rate of speed.  Whereas, this object I saw moved at a snails pace or just seemed to stop right where it was at times.  Unfortunately, I have a small forest out back and this object fell out of my sight through these trees.  I would have liked to have seen it dart off at some amazing rate of speed, that would have confirmed it for me, and likened my story to those I have seen on television.  However, all I have is a \"dancing star\" moving very slowly across the night's horizon. \n \n", "posted": "2005-01-11T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.5493", "city_longitude": "-76.123", "latitude": 39.5493, "longitude": -76.123 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.123, 39.5493 ] } },

I lived in a house that is in a field, but surrounded by woods, it is the highest point in the town.  On a clear night it is absolutely beautiful, you can see everything in the sky, including all flight paths of planes crossing over you.  There was one person in the room with me, and my younger sisters were asleep in their room.  She exclaimed to me \"What is that out there over the trees?!?\"  The forest started maybe 1/4 mile away from the back of the house.  I looked and I figured it was just a really bright star, but then I realized I had never seen that star in that position in the sky ever.  I thought this was really odd because my family and I would lay outside and look at the stars all of the time.  I got a pair of binaculars to get a better picture of it and I saw that it wasn't just one light, like a star, it was two lights very close together, it looked like the headlights of a car.  It sat there for maybe 2 or 3 minutes, and then all of sudden it became just one light instead of two.  I sat there and watched it with this other person, who I might add firmly did not believe in aliens or UFO's, for another couple of seconds.  Suddenly, the light went straight up into the air and hoovered at this new height for another 10 or 15 seconds.  I started to run around my house, turning off all lights, TV, everything electrical that was on.  In my mind somehow I think I was afraid that if it sensed electricity or something coming from my house it would try to land, seeing that my house was the only house in the middle of this big field.  I had never experienced any thing like this, I didn't know what to do.  At this point in time all we could see of it was this \"headlight.\"  Then, it starts moving across the field in the direction of my house.  There was absolutely no noise coming from it, there was just complete silence outside.  I was standing out in the open on my back porch so that way I could clearly se! e what i t was doing; I was terrified.  It continued to move very slowly across the field, I am not sure how high it was off the ground though.  It finally crossed over the corner of my house, about 100ft. above me.  It was a circular or oval type shape, I could see a red dim outline of the craft, like it had red lights all the bottom if it. It was still completely silent.  It moved over my house and kept moving across the field, but to the left now heading towards the trees on the left of my house.  I ran to the big windows on that side of my house and saw it go over the trees.  All I could see of it now was the faint red glow.  It went up over the trees, it raised straight up again and then I could not see it any more.  The other person and I did not know what to do.  We knew that we should call somebody or report it but we didn't know who to call.  She called our local police station, they didn't really say anything.  I told my father the next day about what had happened and he confided in my that he had seen \"things\" out there at night before too, but nothing that close to the house or the ground.  That was the end of it.  I have not seen anything like that since then, I do not live there anymore, but my family still does and as far as I know nothing like that has happend again.  At the time I was 16 years old, and the other witness was about 24 or 25.

I agree and she drives me to her friend's house on the other side of my neighborhood. Once we both arrive the night played out as normal as it could have for the situation for about two hours. I had brought a dab pen with me and remember all of us sharing that watching to wong foo (or lsd's version of it where time stops and its just a single drag queen frowning in a car staring at you soullessly for an hour(don't do drugs, kids.)) about halfway (at least I think) through the movie I don't know how or why but I go from laying on the bed, to standing in the middle of the staircase with nobody around me. I had been entirely teleported in the blink of an eye. I'm there for maybe five seconds before i'm shot into a different room downstairs in the house, and then eventually I am sucked up out the roof through the corner of the house (It felt like i was turned into gas and sucked through a tube, but I kept flipping and sticking to the sides of the wall like one of those sticky knick-knack guys you throw on the wall.) \n \nFrom here I am entirely enveloped by a soupy gold/yellow light that would switch from the gold/yellow glow to a more analogue orange glow. I can hear a part of myself say \"this is deeply wrong\" and I am then shot the image of a face right in front of mine. It was almost humanoid but it was entirely translucent and actually lacked a \"face.\" no eyes, maybe some small indents to indicate a nose or mouth but it as very subtle if it had anything. The face would have horrified me if I saw it in a movie or dream but for whatever reason I stayed entirely calm. As a hospital frequenter (I break bones a lot) I could tell this was some sort of doctors office. the room was small like a patient first room and I could see about two or three more of these entities shuffling around in the background assisting. I was on an operating table of sorts made entirely out of the same light I was enveloped in before. Somehow from here I am able to see the back of my own head and skull outside my body only It doesn't look like my head at all. The only way I could tell it belonged to me is because I saw them start digging a scalpel into the back of the skull and immediately felt the most release of pressure I have felt in my entire life. This was indescribably the most satisfying feeling I have felt in my whole Life and I don't even know what they did. It felt like they had sent a charge of white light through my brain only to remove more white light, like they had purified something. In this state I am sent back into the enveloping light and hear myself once again say \"this is deeply wrong.\" I am immediately transported back to my body, sitting in perfect full lotus pose with my right foot sitting up top. As soon as I look at my right foot I notice a giant white blister on my toe that wasn't there immediately before the experience. I noticed the blister had the same white almost translucent color that the entity from the operating room had. it disappeared within a few days but I couldn't help but worry that contact with the being or the craft I was inside of had exposed me to some kind of radiation/etc. Again, I understand that this will probably be discredited because of my aforementioned illicit drug use but again I strongly feel that I was chosen to be studied/met with at all because of the open state that it allowed me to be in at that time, or to make the story easily discredited (like that one Simpsons episode where Homer got abducted but the aliens drenched him in whiskey so nobody would believe him.) (Again I swear on my mother's life this isn't joke or a made up story.) \n \nwhen I had returned to my girlfriend at the time and her friend they had asked where I went. they said I wasn't gone for too long but they had just noticed me sitting cross-legged on the floor and got worried about me.", "posted": "2022-12-22T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.5493", "city_longitude": "-76.123", "latitude": 39.5493, "longitude": -76.123 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.123, 39.5493 ] } },

When I was walking across the yard I noticed what appeared to be two very bright lights in the sky, one higher than the other. They looked like close stars. I kept walking in the direction of the lights toward the field and stopped at the field to let the dogs do their business while I watched. I had assumed that they were helicopters looking for one of our neighbors who have had a shady past; however, I saw that there were no beams of light coming from the craft as a spotlight would. They were simply bright, a whitish yellow light like that of a typical household bulb. \n \n As I watched the craft appeared to be at about the same altitude, but about .5-1 mile away from each other, making the distant one appear lower in the sky. They were motionless in the air, simply hovering. While watching I noticed that each craft had two strobes that alternated. One red and one white. These lights blinked in unison to each other although on separate craft. The crafts then dimmed simultaneously, although the strobes continued to blink, still in harmony. The craft then traveled off in the same direction parallel to each other, still at the same altitude. \n \n I could not hear any noise, and am very accustomed to seeing and hearing helicopters in the area. Although I cannot judge exactly how far the closest craft was, I would estimate approximately 1/4 mile.

I watched for perhaps 30 seconds and one by one the lights went out all most at the same time. I don't have a clue as to what I saw , but I have lived in the country all my life and see aircraft at night on a regular basis(We live on the approaches to Dulles and BWI airports and are not far from the outer markers). Never saw anything like this before. Unfortunately my wife was not able to see as she was driving and this was on my side of the vehicle to the south of us. I wouldn't have even noticed this had I been driving or not just looking up at the time I did. \n \n", "posted": "2003-08-01T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.580533333333335", "city_longitude": "-77.00096666666667", "latitude": 39.580533333333335, "longitude": -77.00096666666667 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.00096666666667, 39.580533333333335 ] } },

PD)) \n \nI went to sleep at 7am in the morning.  I had a dream that my parents bought a new house and then a friend and I where checking out a room in the house. The room had a back sliding door (glass).  We went outside for some reason and down from the sky past a tree with no leaves a bunch of these tiny balls floated down. well they didnt float they descended down under their own power it seemed but slowly.they started out as barely visible dots in the sky.  These balls looked to be about 10 inches in diameter maybe a little bigger.  The balls I saw were see through navy- light blue that looked plastic with a solid orange core about 3-4 inches in diameter.  They floated around us and we ran inside. One of the balls managed to get in and i picked it out of the air with both my hands cuped around the bottom of the ball.  I dont remember it feeling like plastic or not like plastic, i just remember it feeling like a smooth surface thats how plastic probably feels im sure.  It was very light pretty much weightless.  Anyways it came in and I picked it out of the air and put it outside quickly because i was freaking out on some calm level. when i tryed to shove it outside I closed the door while i was putting it out there so it couldnt get back in kind of what someone would do if they we putting a bug outside. when i put it out it seemed like it tried to get back in as it was ascending but couldnt fit through the 3 inch crack of the door. It ended up going straight up and over the house and the gutter. After that in my dream i was trying to call the police but i couldnt for some reason. Then this is the seemingly fake part that makes me think it really was just a dream. It was a dream but ever since i woke up it just felt so real i have never had such a realistic dream in my life ok heres the fake part. After the ball went over the house i went to the front of the house and there was this small auditorium facing a bunch of glass doors not sliding ! doors like in the back of the house but like office building d! oors. th e seats were facing the front doors. On one of the seats of the auditorium was this sprinkler head looking thing spewing out some kind of dark smoke on two side as it was spinning. it was deployed from one of the balls im pretty sure, so then i grabbed it off the back of the seat and threw it outside onto the ground. Then for some reason the auditorium was full of young to middle age people after i turned back from throwing the sprinkler looking thing out the front door. I remember this all vividly and perfectly but the end part is a little hazy. I remember telling anyone around me to call the police and the military. The police never showed up but i do remember a military guy wearing a decked out military navy blue uniform with lots of metals like you would see on a navy officers coat. Most of the metal were on his left breast like in real life. The military guy was the only one in uniform and he was in the front row of the full auditorium standing up looking at me along wi! th a few others in the front row standing up. He was the only one that stuck out in my mind. This all was probably just a dream. All my logical tells me it was just a dream but my emotions and feelings and body tell me it was real. It was so vivid, it seemed so real and it still does, even while typing this up 3 hours after I had this dream. I have never seen or heard about these types of blue balls with the orange centers so i dont know where i would get the idea about them. very strange. After i woke up i looked outside to see if they were out there and thinking that they would be; there was nothing. This was not at all dissappointing i hope to god it was not real it really freaked me out. I was scared when the balls came down the only reason i grabed the one and put it outside is because no one else was going to so i had to and i feared for my life. same with the sprinkler thing i thought it was trying to harm me in some way. It was probably just a dream but if not i don! t want to see it again and for that matter i hope i never drea! m about it again. disturbing.  I appologize for wasting anyones time for reading this if it was just a dream. I just felt like i really really had to tell someone about this and see if anyone has had a similar dream or experience. i looked on the internet to see if these ball things were common but i couldnt find any thing similar. thank you for your time.", "posted": "2009-12-12T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.5678", "city_longitude": "-76.6026", "latitude": 39.5678, "longitude": -76.6026 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -76.6026, 39.5678 ] } },

To the right of us we saw 15+ crafts hovering above my parent's house. Just as before, only this time I had a witness, and better yet, I wasn't alone!!

I was getting out of my car I noticed all the stars out.I always wanted to look at stars but usually can't see them that great here and no where to go and watch them. I go in the house and tell my husband. Saying how I wish we had some where to watch stars cause they were really out tonight. My husband said we could go on deck and watch them. We were not use to having a deck, so didn't even cross my mind. Ten or fifteen minutes later we go out on deck. It is about 9 pm. We were out there naming the stars like little dipper ect..We were standing in the v part of deck. Where it goes in different direction. I do not know if it was North, South, East or West. Looking straight ahead with head tilted upward a bit.Soon as we got out there we seen a shooting star go from left to right. My first time ever seeing one. Only been looking at them about 2 or 3 minute's when I said,\"hey there is a bunch of stars in the sky right above us but there was some tree branches blocking them a bit\". I said,\" We need to move over a bit up and to the left\". We both started to move in that direction. These stars were straight above us. You had to tilt your head as far as you could to see them. My husband even mentioned that. Next thing I know my husband said, \"Do you see that\". I could see out of the corner of my eye he was facing opposite of where I was looking. I turned around right away and my first thought was oh those are stars but then I realized they were moving. They were so close also. \"Like a football field away from what my husband said anyways. I am horrible with distancing things. Just knew it was close and looked huge from how far lights were separated.It was a zig zag shape. That is at least from what I seen and husband also confirmed. Only could she the lights. Could not see the actual shape of it. Just shape of lights. They were like foggy looking. It looked like it was cloaked. I know that sounds strange but that is just what came to mind. That this looks close and cloaked and I was not suppose to be seeing this. Also it just glided very smoothly. It was just unnatural moving. No jets or engine sounds. Completely silent. You can hear planes way up in the sky before you actually saw them. Then they moved all together for a second and then start moving back to that zig zag. That's when I told my husband come on we are going in now.

I remember thinking, the flashing of the lights reminded me of the ships from the movie Close Encounters. I didn't tell anybody I saw it at the time.

After the light had dimmed the object never seemed to change in speed but the direction was definately moving away from us.  It remained dim and I followed it until it got too small to see.  It seemed to be going away from earth.  This all took place in under a minute.  What ever I saw was moving faster then any airplane I've seen.

I know that some people could confuse an airplane at great distance, but I am confident it was not an airplane because it was nowhere near the normal air traffic lanes for those two major airports.  I am puzzled as to what I may have seen?  I have always looked up when I'm outside at night and seen many aircraft and shooting stars alike.  I just have no frame of reference what I saw.

IT GOT LOUDER AND LOUDER. I KEPT WAITING FOR THIS TRUCK TO PASS. IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. IT WAS SO LOUD THAT WE WERE TRYING TO TALK OVER IT. WHEN THE SOUND DIDN'T RECEDE I WENT TO MY KITCHEN THINKING THAT MY DISHWASHER WAS GETTING READY TO EXPLODE (THE SOUND WAS SO LOUD AND SO CLOSE). IN THE KITCHEN I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND ACROSS THE STREET OVER A HOUSE I SAW A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT WITH A BEAM THAT WAS SHINING DOWN BEHIND THE HOUSE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A POLICE HELICOPTER SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE. BUT IT WAS SO LOUD (SO LOUD THAT YOU COULD ALMOST FEEL IT) AND THE CRAFT (WHICH I COULD NOT SEE BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK AND THE LIGHT COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF IT WAS SO BRIGHT)WAS NOT MOVING. IT WAS STATIONARY. SO I RAN OUTSIDE TO GET A BETTER LOOK AND THE NOISE WAS UNBELEIVABLY LOUD. I'VE NEVER HEARD A POLICE HELICOPTER SOUND LIKE THIS.

THE LIGHT WAS ROUND LIKE A STROBE LIGHT. A BUNCH OF LIGHTS MAKING UP THIS STROBE LIGHT. THE LIGHTS WERE WHITE. WHEN THIS THING MOVED WE RAN INTO THE HOUSE BECAUSE WE WERE SCARED OF THAT BEAM AND DIDN'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT UNDERNEATH IT. WE WERE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND IT WAS MOVING (NOT FAST) FLYING OVER OUR HOUSE. WE COULDN'T SEE IT ANYMORE BUT THE BEAM STILL SHONE DOWN BEHIND THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET (FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE SKY BEHIND OUR HOUSE) I CALLED MY HU!

I noticed the a/c was completly motionless for several mins. with on noticeble engine sound. this is almost imposible even for a \"helo\", when another a/c appeared along side the other out of no where!

As the a/c closed in on my location I could here a humming sound from the a/c, when it reached my location I could see half of the a/c through the tree line. The a/c was still at approx. 100 ft. agl. and to large to be a \"helo\" I could see the aft section of this a/c as it moved past my location and noted that the trees were not being moved from any downward thrust at this alt. any manmade a/c would hve to produce 1 to 1 thrust ratio to stay aloft, but yet no sign of this? I did however hear some lite jet fan sound as the a/c were directly over head. The a/c design was unlike anything I HAVE EVER SEEN. After the a/c moved on I noticed other identical a/c moving south to north east & west of my location with the other 2 a/c moving out in the same direction.

I made my boyfriend come out and look. He also saw it, it went over my house so I did not see where it went.  I watched the sky and off in the distance over the houses across the street I spotted another one, blending in with the stars, I watched it – every “star” it passed brightened as it was passing it and dimmed again after it passed, I watched it until it disappeared - my boyfriend came out and saw it right before it disapeared.  Since there are street lights out front it was kind of hard to see, so I went out back (about 9:45pm) and kept looking up in the sky.  As I was looking at the stars, suddenly one started moving across the sky and as it was headed straight for another “star”, that star shifted right and let it! go by then it moved back into place.

Nightly I look to the stars and the Universe in search of answers as many have done over the expanse of life. This particular night I stepped out with my dog to allow her to use the restroom. Looking into the Universe as I have done every night past. I noticed two unusually bright stars in the sky, so I stood outside and watched them for sometime. 30 minutes perhaps I would say. Emitted from the objects i noticed what appears to be a unifomity thats not noticed from stars. Looking at light closely we notice it steches into what appears to be a burst of light and there is no formality among the light. Unless the light is directed! Nor is it geometical to the eye. \n \nHowever I noticed a pattern in the light that i saw. Which is clealy distinguishable among the stars, as the light emitted from them differ from star light. Coming out of the object on the top or upper side of the object is what appears to be a triangle of light. This triangle of light appears to be beems of light one would have to assume. I do not know what else to make of it. Emitted from the bottom half of the craft or object is what appears to form a upside down \"Y\".

Remeber I am an artist, so I have a keen eye for proportions in perspective to that of our visual field. The light getting bright was it coming closer to me. As the light got closer it intensified in brightness and size!  While outside watching them to determine what I was seeing was real. I noticed that they both emitted some type of search/spot light. This could be seen as something clearly above the clouds was lighting clouds up below it. This light appeared as a search light of some sort. At this point I was starting to get frightened. Basically I was right by the entrance of the house, as uncertainty coursed through me. As I watched the light circle around, and at times lighting up the clouds. It came to stop on me. I stood there helpless, wanting to run inside though was unable to move. Which lead and leads me to believe this was or is some type of probe of some sort. Standing there it fealt as if information was being expelled from me. I too took notice it seemed to extract the information in waves, rather than all at once. It seemed almost rythmatic!

So we drove up to Hyde Park where the lookout spot is and could see a disk like object hovering above Santa Fe. \n \nThe sightings I am reporting now are above Taneytown, MD.  I have not lived here long but since I have moved here I have been noticing different things.  Last winter I saw a falling object over a local park, it was too large to be a falling star.  I have noticed an object that travels parallel with a main road- the lighted object moves so slow it is almost not noticeable it is moving unless you are actually watching it. \n \nI have also noticed that around 9pm there is a light in the sky behind where we live.  To give an idea of the diameter; stars vs. \"the light\"   it is like the stars are pin-heads and “the light” is a pencil eraser.  The light is not directly above me when I see it; it is off in the distance a bit. To show attempt to express the distance it travels within an amount of time; if you were to go on my back porch with a ruler and hold it up, the bottom of the ruler lined up with the roof top of the house-- the light starts out about 12 inches above the house diagonally behind us, then by 10pm the light is level with the chimney top of the same house.  Not sure how else to explain it.  The light is not directly above the house it is off in a distance.  Just using perspective to explain how it moves.  Also it does not move in a straight line – it slowly zigzags as it moves forward.  My friend and I went looking for it the other night but it was slightly cloudy out and lost it.  We a! re going to attempt it again on another night.  This light is out there every night – but I have not noticed it on rainy nights because I don’t go out there when it is raining. \n \nEarlier tonight I saw something in my peripheral vision above me out front.  It was a very large green glow shooting across the sky.  It was round in the front and it definitely was not a shooting star, if I would have held my fist in the air it would have been bigger than my fist. And it disappeared right after I looked up.", "posted": "2010-06-23T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.6688", "city_longitude": "-77.1723", "latitude": 39.6688, "longitude": -77.1723 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.1723, 39.6688 ] } },

I looked up from the screen to see what I thought was a plane getting ready to land at Frederick airport, which is about 20 miles away.  But I noticed it didnt move and the light on it was getting brighter.  Now it was probably a good 2-3 miles from the house.  It looked like a star.  It shot straight up.  Then without a sound it wizzed above and past my house.   As it past and got closer. I noticed it was triangular in shape and black but had three round lights on the bottom.  The closer it got the bigger it looked.  I would say at a whole the ship was the size of a jet plane.  But a full black triangle.  And the round lights where probably a good 4-5 feet in diameter. It was very quiet.  I heard a slight hum as it passed over me.  I've been wanting to tell someone but didn't want to sound crazy.  I don't know what it was.  But it definitely sent me inside for the night.", "posted": "2019-12-19T00:00:00", "city_latitude": "39.6128", "city_longitude": "-77.3991", "latitude": 39.6128, "longitude": -77.3991 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.3991, 39.6128 ] } }
